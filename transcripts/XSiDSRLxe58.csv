XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,1032,They could have blah, blah, blah.  Like, it's never enough.  People are pretty nice about Bill Gates.  I don't know.  I don't hear lefties talk about him, but Bill Gates is like almost like a literal  in terms of like the Mullen, Bill and Mullen Gates Foundation and shit, so it's pretty hard to attack them.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,1057,They could actually donate a large percentage of their current wealth in it.  I don't know if to throw that much money, something would help, and also I don't think it's reasonable to expect somebody to just be like,  I'm gonna go ahead and give my business to charity right like that's not like

XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,1401,How did I hit shot him?  My scans indicate there is a lift at the center of this facility.  I'm just gonna go.  Wait, what party are we now?  You're in the moat room?  I just passed them in, huh?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,1428,I already got the elevator one.  Um, when you do the moat room, do you remember the feeling that like you're an NPC and somebody  I mean that what do you mean what do you mean by that please explain it I will be

XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,1518,Is it gonna cause him to stumble or is he just gonna kill me right after?  Should I reset chat  Fuck two lives on the first area you'd what I  Ran out of ammo at the last boss at the last spider go for it
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,1535,I'll give you a second to catch up because somebody just linked some hella interesting shit. What is this?  What are you thinking about chat?  Bad Bunny reflects in relationship with Destiny.  We watched this clip earlier.  Some guys did some digging from what she said about Destiny in the past year along with
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,1552,some stuff I personally remember.  Bad Bunny rants about Destiny.  Bad Bunny calls Destiny a coward and a terrible friend who is afraid of his community and  that's why he won't ever defend her.  Bad Bunny calls Destiny a despicable person and a hypocrite for deleting train wrecks
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,1567,hate threads but not her.  Hers.  Badmani Weizhen of the Destiny's on drama  calls Destiny a clout chaser.  Cultivates an in-style community,  uses shitty rhetoric and is the bench  superior of the left.  Destiny never defend him because he's afraid
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,1581,of being a white knight.  Dude, I'll white knight like a motherfucker.  You do it.  What the fuck?  Destiny Gish Galps never defend him  because he's scared of being a white knight.  Destiny sided with white supremacists  and engaged in Nazi apologia to troll the libs.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,1594,Why do people still like him?  Also his community docks as people.  Destiny's transphobic, Destiny's a holocaust defender, bad money says Destiny is a liberal  larper who attacks true leftists.  I'm more progressive than Destiny now, and Destiny is an abuser.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,1609,He abused me.  I remember these lugs.  Did you?  Yeah.  No.  Shout out to Destiny.  Thank you, Destiny, for making me so much more famous than I ever could be.  Why does Destiny so angry at me?  I think there might be some mental problems or something.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,1625,I don't know Jesus, but  Yeah, but like it feels like she basically like got I guess got tired of Mike because Mike wouldn't stand up to her bowling and  Now she's looking for new friends again. I don't know. This is the cycle of Nicole
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,1649,You defended the holocaust  I think I was bowling some lefties on Twitter and I said something like at least the Nazis never like starved a bunch of people blah blah blah  Like the USSR that which isn't true technically the Nazis did start people
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,1659,It was kind of a dumb tweet  But I was trying to make an illusion to the hold them or but then people turned it into Nancy apology  Okay, dude  Okay back in the game did you restart  What should we start now?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,1675,I might I'm not winning this run. I might as well practice  You're gonna be practicing well, I'm gonna be fucking win win  You need all the practice you can get remember guys he's doing him he's doing a marathon. I'm doing a race

XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,1841,Oh wait, holy shit.  The videos that are played in here?  I think our actual videos, it's not like being rendered by the game's engine.  Why?  Do you think it's easier to do it that way?  I just noticed that, because there's like,
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,1853,like artifacting a shit on the  don't know  let's wait is it  lower load times less performance oh i guess  okay i'm sorry okay  gain a speed boost this seems cool the speed boost after getting a glory kill  actually seems really useful

XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,14870,go red.  Somewhere in your arena there's like a little totem that spawns.  It's in the same spot every time you have to melee it and it'll  hold the time and then  All the enemies it will actually die because if you kill them all the time comes up they respawn. Oh
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,14887,Fuck, I don't know where the totem is  If it's the first buck to make honor, it's no  Portals will open eventually, but maybe they did  I'm running out of ammo because I'm not chain-sung enough.  That's what's happening right now, guys.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,14909,oh it's here  one  of even working on

XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,15215,Oh  Funny good meme  I'm just fucking ammo on this shit.  Buff totem increased speed and damage rate by damage rate by damage to the enemy's  spawns with the buffed on the destroyed, mainly the tone to remove the buffed on demons.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,15246,Look for a breakable wall.  Okay.  Whoa.  else.

XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,15468,We'll send them to them only you rip and tear until it is done  In your defense Steven, that's probably like the worst encounter in the entire game like design was  It's just weird cuz I'm getting like teleported around I have no fucking idea what I'm stepping
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,15494,I don't see any like normal the teleporters. Yes kind of I guess I got lucky poor. It was poorly designed fucking  Encounter the game are those green things the teleporters. Yeah  That guy that was in the cage shooting was he glitched or can you like does he break out?

XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,15619,Mowing down, booting.  Slaying demons.  So many knows what the fuck.  Moon's got it, dude.  I believe.  Does it get much harder than this or not?  Um, there's a couple of boss encounters and then subsequent  enemy encounters that are kind of tough.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,15640,So it gets kind of like slightly.  I have a red suit now.  I can go through this forever, right?  It's not going to fucking give out.  What's not going to give up?  The red suit.  Oh, no, you have to like replenish it or whatever.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,15653,Oh, OK.  See.  When I was dying on that, um, that last encounter RNA,  the, uh, it gave me this option to spawn with a certain type of suit.  Is that why you cheat codes?  Yeah, it's a cheat.  Okay, that's the game noting that you're dying a lot or
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,15672,Oh my god, really?  It was like my third death on it  Don't worry. It happened to me a nightmare too. I was a boss fight  I kept fucking up on and it offered me the Prater suit or whatever
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,15685,Or a son of a wire that's it I feel kind of ashamed  I didn't realize there was the health bar at the top of the screen  So when I died the first time the fucker was almost like to the second phase
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,15694,that's when I popped into the chat and I was like I don't know what I'm doing he won't die  Have you guys seen Tiger King yet I have watched a little bit of it shit  Where am I supposed to go chat?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,15716,It's this Netflix show about these big cat people.  I don't like, you know, keep them doing  for cat petting and then there's some drama  and someone maybe killed their husband  and fed it to a tiger.  What the fuck?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,15729,Yeah, it's like a talk.  It was supposed to be, oh yeah, it was supposed to be,  it was supposed to be like,  they were making it like as a documentary.  But then,  Follow the sludge, Moot.  I got way crazy again.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,15740,Yeah.  Well, they got it.  You go down that way?  I did, but I didn't.  Maybe I lost it.  Well, that guy like was recording a bunch of shit  about himself anyway, just because he's fucking that job.  He seemed like a perfect streamer, honestly.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,15757,I thought he was from Florida.  I'm going to be honest.  He was.  It was?  Oh, wait.  No, it was Mississippi, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, when I saw him.  Where do I go now, aren't I?  I'm watching.  Under?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,15767,Keep going.  Yeah. And then left.  Under and then left.  Yeah, like that little with all the fucking fireballs are being spat out or whatever.  Yeah, I can miss it. Okay, I got the teleporter.  Okay, now.  Oh, I think I saw. Oh, yeah.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,15792,There's a climbable.  Yeah, got it.  I like this change of scenery where  Mooten is.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,15822,RNA, how long did it take you to beat it?  Um, wait, which nightmare or extra life mode or whatever?  Uh, nightmare.  10 and a half hours.  Jubita extra life.  Yeah, I beat it today.  I think it took me around nine and I'm going to try ultra nightmare and like the next week or so.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,15839,It's doable. It's just like, I don't know. You need a couple of playthroughs so they  got to get really used to everything. And then I think it's a lot less daunting.  I just feel there's like a super defeated feeling when you get certain so far and then
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,15856,you just fucking die. I don't know if you know this, but that thing takes in my pocket.  Nice one. Finally, that's where you get the chain gun.  your  dad's  and better with another gun but maybe not sure yet also fuck you for the RNA was a good verification
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,15892,I gotta make sure you haven't even be it so I gotta as someone who knows which would go now fuck me  is losing  she'll depraved was flamethrower is a godly combo  oh yeah
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,15922,the  is the right click slowdown worth it  in the early game  I think it is I think it's really good don't do it to the crash  it might be a crash  but I well I would even say it's a fucking crash I think it is good
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,15941,it's really good for that boss fight  of that last one the with the one that I just did the same  we got a cat I did not. Is it familiar? Get it dandy.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,15979,visit  Trish  them  to recover. And then the last one that I'm not too confident on is that I perform  glory kills faster. But the only reason I died there fucking liken. Oh yeah. Okay.

XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,25016,Boom!  Do you think that means Wall Street goes on lockdown?  Yeah, that's why I'm asking.  So if he quarantines New York, is this Trump's master plan for fixing the market?  I don't think...  I don't think so.  I don't think Wall Street will close.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,25039,There's no way, right?  Quarantine New York City, how do you get people to the...  Frater 4.  Oh my god, hold on one second.  What the fuck?  How long are your pins on the switch?

XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,25526,I thought our chainsaw doesn't go.  Yeah, I know.  Have I been using that?  I don't think I have any health to know.  Namely, I suppose the game is decreased.  Damage and killing frozen enemies will drop health.  That actually sounds really good.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,25543,Or we could go for cooldown reduction.  Frozen enemies dropping health actually seems gods to me.  I usually use the frozen bomb when I'm liking it in a shit moment.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,25614,Nope, too far away.  Ouch.  Is this it?  No, not yet.  This might be it.

XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,26639,has boys  my list of debate Russine of the  Feels weird, man.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,26689,Why would Destiny platform a guy?  platforms a guy who is a colonialist and an imperialist.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,26721,So what are you guys all doing tonight?  Anything exciting?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,26751,fucking my mom right now. That's a little awkward. Sorry to interrupt. Hey, how many  people are fucking my mom right now what the fuck?  Stop.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,26790,You know what I'm tired of?  I'm tired of these phone alerts waking me up when I go to sleep at like noon.  Okay, I don't want to be woken up three hours later from my phone going fucking eep shit
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,26803,giving me a national Amber Alert sound saying people 65 years or older shouldn't leave the  house.  I'm not 65 years or older.  I don't need this alert.  Putting it on silent doesn't work.  I think you'd have to turn off alerts in general.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,26831,Life alert, yeah.  You know what's really good, chat?  I'm gonna tell you a good sandwich.  Okay, here's where we start.  There's two options here.  You can either go with the croissant  or lightly toasted rye bread.  That's where we start.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,26851,Then we take a few slices of hot pastrami, okay?  Put them on that sandwich, okay?  Next step, thin sliced red onions.  That's right, we're not done yet.  A layer of Swiss cheese  and a little dab of mayonnaise.  Tell me that is not a premium fucking sandwich, okay?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,26874,And if you're saying it's not, you hit is.  It's a good sandwich.  You substitute mustard for a little bit of mayo on this, but that's a really good  sandwich.  This try me in general is pretty good.  You know what else is really good?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,26904,Uh, salami.  Ah, thin sliced salami.  Fucking true.  Not exactly low in calories, but hey, you only live once as far as we know.  Are you a Cuban sandwich?  I like more than I like Cubans, I like Medi Anochas.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,26922,I like the little bit of a softer bread.  But yes, those are good.  Those are good.  I like ham, Swiss cheese, and mustard.  pretty good but if you ever go to a Cuban place ask for the Medi and Noche,
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,26934,Noche instead of the Cuban and you'll see you'll seem extra cool as well.  In and out are five guys. I don't think either of them is particularly amazing.  I know that's gonna offend a bunch of you guys. I guess it depends what you want.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,26955,So In and out has kind of thinner patties, right? It's kind of like a  McDonald's style cheeseburger and then five guys has a bigger, you know, slice of meat  in there and it's not bad but neither of these are like gourmet like really, you know, whatever,
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,26975,cheeseburger, it's fine, you know what I mean?  You know how much better cheeseburger than both of those places?  The Shake Shack, right?  That's not like no one's out here fucking standing Shake Shack.  It's just a better, it tastes better.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,26987,You know, it's just better.  But there's other places that are, you know, whatever.  Living now, it's really good for the price.  Like, the ticket.  I haven't been there since I lived in LA,  like a decade ago or whatever.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,26999,So it's hard for me to really remember.  I just, you know, even when I lived there,  so I lived next to an in and out,  I was never like, man, I'm craving in and out.  It was just a thing that you would guess.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27013,like going to McDonald's.  You know, I do crave McDonald's sometimes.  I will say there's one thing that you will crave sometimes,  not that you would ever put it on God  to your cheeseburger level,  but that would be like an in-and-out or crystal burger.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27026,Those are sometimes all that you crave  in that little thin patty, right?  Or not, did I say in-and-out?  No, sorry, I mean, crystal or what the fuck is it called?  What's the other one?  There's crystal burger in white castle?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27042,Yeah, white castle.  Yeah, that's what I meant.  Is it White Castle the one with the really small,  like, tiny burgers?  Yeah, exactly.  And they have the square ones or something like that.  But yeah.  You can order like a box of cheeseburgers.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27058,Yeah, I didn't, yes, you can.  And it's good.  It's good.  You're saying no one craves those tiny burgers?  That's false.  I used to live right off of Bourbon Street.  And believe me, sometimes all you want in the world
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27071,is a fucking crystal burger.  So you're just goddamn wrong.  Look at yourself and think, wow,  how did I ever get so wrong?  Listen, kids, most of you in here,  your food taste is not refined enough.  Okay, let me tell you, I've been eating cheeseburgers
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27093,since before you were a thought and your daddy's balls.  Don't forget that.  It's true.  Okay, boomer.  It's true.  and they want to tell me about what a cheeseburger is?  Uh uh uh.  Fellow boomers that are out there, my 30 plus boys,
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27110,I know there's a few of us out there,  we're not the majority, but that's fine.  Tell these fucking goddamn zoomers to know their place,  to sit the fuck down and do what we tell them,  to respect your elders, people who have gone and lived
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27123,and tried more than one fucking things.  The only tendies you haven't had  is what mom brought down to you in the basement  when you're playing fucking Halo,  not because it just came out because you're trying to look cool playing a vintage game.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27134,Fuck that shit.  What do you got against some good tendies, Dan?  Well, you know what?  Nothing really.  You know what else in Totinos?  They suck.  Fuck Totinos.  They're never good.  Why is this a thing?  We're like, oh, mom, let me get some Totino.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27152,Fuck Totinos.  It's like 90% breading.  It's like a fucking shitty hot pocket.  Do you have an air fryer? Yes I do, but it just became too much work. We don't use  shit for it.  Thank you for giving me something to listen to at work.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27179,So what are you up to today, Mr. Eyelide about Cake?  I'm just ruining my sleep schedule, playing video games.  What were you known as before Portal?  Um, I don't want to give that out.  Oh yes.  We can talk about that.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27195,Cake is so original.  He took his name from a video game.  Good one Daniel.  Good one.  My name is biblical.  Alright, your name.  My name is David.  Of course it's biblical.  That's not what you go by.  That doesn't count.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27212,Because only losers go by their name.  what are you gonna call yourself on the internet? Oh, I'm gonna call myself Dan. Yeah, cuz that's my  9,000 IQ you assert your dominance over the  Working class the working class in video game. Yes
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27233,Bible Dan no holy land  I'm bringing back the, the, uh, scam call streams, bringing them back.  Good.  There are five long years.  They're, they're returned.  They're coming back.  Well, I need entertainment at these hours.  So I'm good.  Well, I've messed up my sleep schedule enough now that I'm working from home.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27260,I yesterday I woke up at like 10 30 p.m. So living just like you waking up random hours of the day.  Oh my god. Rem and mind waves are fighting again on Twitter or are they on a podcast?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27279,Of course on Twitter.  Is there been a day where Rem has not been going in on someone on Twitter?  You mean a day when Rem didn't crave attention by any means possible from any source you can possibly get it?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27296,No, I don't think such a day has ever  Hey guys have you forgot about me? I haven't been here. Hey, here's here's someone I'm calling out. My my bad  Dan, I'm done with Twitch, by the way.  I'm done with Twitch, but I'm still my life revolves around it, by the way.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27327,Wasn't Rem quitting Twitch? Guys, don't worry.  Anything he says has no real substance and means nothing.  So whenever Rem says something, you just have to, you know, basically know that he's gonna go back on that two minutes later
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27340,And he'll use some sort of weird excuse to do that, right?  So in this case of quitting Twitch, he'll of course be back on shortly because, you know, his word means nothing  So, yeah, I'm sure we'll see you soon.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27367,Mind waves the based flat earther. Is that true mind waves?  Mind waves really flat earther. I think he is. Uh oh. That feels weird.  I don't know how I feel about platforming a flat earth or  Well, Johnny might make in mind place by make another podcast
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27385,as  so what are we thinking about  in chat today guys what's everyone thinking about just go ahead  and type the first word  Let's go ahead and throw it out and chat.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27416,Just do it.  Wow, a lot of people are thinking about my mom.  A lot of yeas out there.  Yep.  No one the winners.  He wins.  Yep.  Are you true?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27454,Dan, are we doing viewer call-in stuff?  Oh no, you got that steed.  Daniel, what's on your mind? What are you thinking thoughts about?  I'm wondering why Mr. Minton is in chat, but not in voice.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27487,That seems to be kind of a consistent pattern that I see from him.  He'll leave a few hours into like 8 p.m. 9 p.m. saying, I'm tired.  I'm going to bed.  But then we all observed him continue to participate in chat for several hours.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27502,You know what he's doing in bed.  You know what's going on.  You can do that just on talk.  And honestly, it's just kind of selfish behavior,  you know, depriving chat of content  because he wants to grab himself like, you know,
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27518,very true.  He needs to get those dirty thoughts out of his mind  and get on voice.  Takes so long, right?  Like he left hours ago,  but he's still here talking in chat.  She knows some time, he's just in chat, you know,
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27531,scrolling for links right now.  any linkers?  Although I'm really bad at that too.  Like, oh, I'm going to go to bed now and spend like the next three hours  like chatting with people.  I'm really bad at doing that.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27550,Well, I more so feel sad for new salsa who shares an apartment with Mr.  Mervin because, you know, whenever Mr.  Mervin's like, okay, that's it.  I'm going off and then he goes to his room and locks the door.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27560,And for the next three hours,  Musalsa knows what's going on behind that door,  but he can't say anything.  And he's just hearing these sounds and, you know,  grunting coming from the room.  And he's just...  Ranting. Yeah, he's grunting.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27572,He can't invite anyone over.  He can't like, you know,  he has to act like he doesn't know what's going on,  but then moving comes out like three hours later,  like all like sweating and, you know, just flustered with like a red face.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27583,He goes right to washing his hand.  Yeah, exactly. And it's like,  So, what were you doing?  True.  All right, you want true two, two 100% true, but possibly controversial food takes, ready?  Go.  Number one, the ends of the loaves just throw them away.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27606,True.  Throw them the fuck away.  That's number one.  Number two, if you serve a burger or a sandwich that's too tall to like take a bite out of,  It's you automatically lose two points. Why do people make food like that? Don't be it's not for show
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27619,It's for eating okay stupid as fuck you'll get that a lot of like restaurants  Yeah, we have to cut the burger in half to even be able to try some shit. Yeah fuck that  Yeah, not good  Did uh did miss Kiff's drama stream ever pan out to be anything fun
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27639,What was that gonna be about?  I thought about exposing Rekful who he really is or some dumb shit.  Wait, really? That sounds fucking hilarious.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27681,Hmm.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27737,Well, the reason why I've been, oh thank you babe, check this out guys.  The low-live-life property cake
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27769,and a cookie and a milk  How fucking lucky am I?  This is beautiful. Thank you, bye  This guy's not even that strong. If you watch him lift, he curves his back when he deadless. What a weak fuck. Get this guy out of here
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27785,I mean, Bran is the best story so...
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27815,As the outbreak has swept across the world, a few places have seemed to have things more  under control. One of them is Taiwan. Late this week, Taiwan had recorded 250-  NINE WAVES! Debate Pixie! What are you doing?  Mm hmm.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27838,The two cases and the voice line was deaths a much lower percentage than its larger East  Asian neighbors.  Taipei says that he had the age of December, a lot of the moderate very men to human children.  No, morally moderated.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27853,I had to come in afterwards and clean up because you did a such a shitty fucking job.  False.  I get blood.  You get them to be goddamn friends.  That's the difference.  They are friends.  Nothing more that bridges.  Those concerns were not passed on right now.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27866,All right.  Despite being shut up by China and the WHO, Taiwan's efforts in combating the outbreak  were recognized by the European Union in a recent video conference.  Would the WHO consider Taiwan's membership?  Hello?  Was it possible?  Hello?  We didn't have to.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27894,I couldn't hear your question.  Okay, let me repeat the question.  Let's move to another one then.  I'm actually curious on talking about Taiwan as well, on Taiwan's case.  decided to give Dr. Howard another call to follow up.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27944,I don't believe this I  I feel like this was edited.  Has anybody commented on this?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,27977,you guys know it's real. They take the Taiwan China ship seriously? If that's true, why would  they even agree to do the interview though? Like what would be the why would he agree to do it?  He must know that a question like this is coming right like this doesn't make any sense
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,28047,Lady Rain is dumb as fuck. Mine waves don't.  Everything this person says is fucking stupid.  Mine waves happen to voice dude. What are you waiting for?  Do it.  No mind waves yet.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,28079,Okay, I don't like the diced vegetables for sandwiches. I think they have to be larger slices because too many of them fall out of the sandwich  Oh shit  What?  You're lucky my lips are really making me crawl out of my coom machine for this
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,28103,Okay, you can't be copy-pacing things in chat talking shit. You're not gonna debate mind-waver  Through mind waves that is the way of the West  Mind waves how true is it that you're ready to burn this bridge as you put it
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,28125,If I keep out if like if she I don't know dude  I'm tired of feeling like I need to put kids gloves on when I talk to pixie  I'm not kids gloves to not laugh down somebody when you're talking through that's like kids clothes. It's just not being an asshole
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,28142,I want to be an asshole fuck it true  Listen that's totally fine if that's what you want. That's okay. Just be clear about that  you like listen I don't like you okay I'm gonna go hard just say it be forward
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,28157,about it  yeah we're doing it like incur  We're off to a good start. Can we get Pixie in here?  You got this power favored on the  I have a trick or something
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,28189,This is really important  quiz
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,28219,Time babes, would you say that a...  Hm, Tixie is a dishonest...  This... ...debater?  Or...  No?  I...  I think that she...  Well, I don't know that dude.  The way that she's been characterizing...  My character is a... ...her...  I feel like it's pretty dishonest.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,28236,It's pretty dishonest.  I can see your perspective on that.  Yeah, but you can.  Mr. Padpa, you gotta tell me what clip you're linking.  Don't just link me a clip and expect me to do the five minutes of tab out to go and listen to it
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,28248,to it because it box my game when I tab out tell me what it is I'll watch it for  you sir thank you it's Mr. Mitten in doom low health dying okay thank you  yeah that's what it is and then he yells got you
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,28270,Okay, fuck weapon upgrades.  We're gonna get a Prater soup point.  Not that?  Yes, this.  What happened?  Why are you getting fucked?  I'm still wearing my ship from yesterday.  I ended the stream, just passed the fuck out.  Woke up, now we're here.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,28291,Not so easy being on the line light.  Is it mine players?  Dude, living that neat life stuff.  It's in lifestyle right now.  all it's made up to be is it? You said you wanted the attention, now you got it. A little bit more
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,28304,frisky than you would expect though.  You know what? My family went out of town too. I could have just spent all day  They shit-posting in DGG, cooling, would have been good.  But here I am, I'm gonna have this shit ass debate.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,28337,Well, you don't have to.  You can just bitch out.  I think this is a little pussy ass, bitch ass motherfucker.  You really want to go.  I mean, you know, you got that, right?  I mean, I'm hoping the mind-blapes goes a little bit hard.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,28348,It feels like he's been so extra charitable  and all of the debates he's done at this point so far  that, you know, it'd be a fresh breath of air  to be able to really see mind waves, you know,
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,28359,have some balls and stick up for himself  and, you know, get his point across.  He's too charitable.  I think that's really the problem.  True, Dan.  True.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,28379,Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm in Destiny's Discord.  Oh, well then I have to go on the other side to get the start.  So it's kind of awkward that Pixie, who has such a strong belief in her views, wouldn't
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,28394,come here to defend them.  Why do you think that is?  Oh no, she doesn't see the message yet.  I imagine she's seen the message.  I don't know, do you tell me why?  What do you...  I don't know, do you think that's because she fears you as a master debater?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,28408,Or do you think that's because she doesn't believe in her views?  is a little bit scared as a result of this but you're opinion.  Maybe, maybe her ego got destroyed.  Okay, last thing we talked about.  Sorry, I don't know.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,28422,So you think there's a possibility that she will not return to the date because of the  she abused the last debate that you had as a failure to herself?  Possibly. No comment.  Good damn it, Pixie just popped in.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,28439,What's up fucking? What is this?  What's she saying?  Nothing. That's the problem.  I think she doesn't see it. That's a tenet tactic.  You can tell sometimes when there's drama going on,  and you see someone focusing on something else a little bit too hard,
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,28457,you know what's going on. They know what's going on,  and they're trying to act like they don't care about something going on.  That's very very tenant status. I don't say so  Did Rem really make that fire earth comment about me and think that that was like a huge gun
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,28479,one  at one to get upon them  and  if  down  I'm going to go through one day, five, and we can only three.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,28519,Alrighty?  Fuck, I'm talking.  Oh, she's typing.  She's typing the name.  Hoggress.  Hoggress.  I hope it's not my excuse.  Like, I don't want to debate with a dishonest debate tactic person like yourself.  That would be real data.  It's some sort of response.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,28537,Other than I'm coming right now, what channel are you in this bear?  That's just beta.  That's bad.  I'm just feeling a little tired right now.  Okay, I'm fucking to rim right now.  Well, Rem made it a whole day before getting off Twitch, huh?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,28553,She's doing her anime training montage right now.  Fuck it. Get him in here. I'll go full.  Sure you want to do that?  Oh shit.  That's a bad idea, my sister.  Prepare for that.  I like telling you, the multi-person thing, it brings in,
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,28582,And it's a deep psychological thing that's a little bit harder to debate when you think  that everyone else is nodding your eyes.  Don't do that.  That's a bad idea.  Lots of years of practice.  Also, I don't particularly want to hear about how either you are for platforming and then
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,28602,stealing practical.  No!  No, okay, I put Graham maybe  No, yeah, I need to do the lock on shit  the  folder is not being a beta
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,28633,the ground is often  where are the disappearing guys  one  one and a fifteen
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,28678,Hey, my way to select  that  Where?  Wait I got 30 from that guy.  Okay, I'm supposed to be toodin and friend just like cuz he hasn't read anything on the subject. Oh, I can't

XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,28917,one  If  Warner  she's falling for the other people to talk about things later on ba  Oh, god.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,28957,That's correct though? Sure, but baked into that is the assumption that if you haven't  gone to college for it, if you don't have a degree, if you haven't read the right books,  then you just just shut the fuck up and stop being a Twitch streamer.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,28969,Wait, what the fuck is happening?  Wait, you guys are losers.  Oh, this goes up and shit, never mind.  I mean, if Pixie's actually read about this shit, she did as bad as she did in our last debate, and I haven't read shit.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,28991,I think that's a lot.  Ohhh!  Um...  No, not this bullshit.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,29031,Oh, I see the portals now.  Oh, that's still closed!  Hey, no!  No more!  Open up!
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,29061,No, I need more fuel!
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,29121,See you.  It spawns infinitely, right?  When does it open so I can fucking kill it?  I have to take the portals  Fucking Christ two levels wasted here. Okay, I understand a little better now
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,29161,now  fuck this room dude holy shit  Did I say love?  Ram calling someone else mode.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,29204,I feel it.  Uh oh.  Is our run about to die, boys?  Is that a Slayer portal?  or is it a monster challenge?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,29238,It's not a slayer.  It's just a challenge.  Fuck it dude.

XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,29369,There's another extra life in the open area yeah I just don't remember how to  there's a place I could jump from here to get it. So is Pixie just hyping herself  off right now before she comes on having a neck and chain.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,29381,I can't do it. It's the anime fucking training montage going on right now.  That's weird. I would have thought it'd be something like that.  You're the thought.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,29414,No! Wait, did that count?  He turned around!  It has to be three different types of glory kills.  Fuck me.  Load from checkpoint?  Whoa! That sounds suspiciously like cheating my dude, chill.  You sound salty as fuck for someone confident?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,29443,I just want to fucking I want to go make food dude. I just want to get this over with  the  get the run  no i think i missed something i missed something back there  must be only accessible via like a teleporter assumption
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,29466,Hey, don't you get that going for the last portal?  Damn.  I mean, it was one portal we had to bounce in.  Any dank grillers in chat?  What the fuck?  What the fuck do I get over?  I mean I'll be back in like three minutes
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,29508,Wait, how the fuck do I get over there guys?  You don't get it from here  Oh, maybe from over there.  Okay, somebody said right outside the door here.  There's a level.  There's a plus one.  Are you talking about the one that I just got right here or is there another one?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,29539,path  until  its under their permit
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,29571,th  th  death  th  death  of  this amount of  Okay, I don't think I can get that for now.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,29614,I can't get that one from now either.  Room with the slamming demon thing?  This thing?  You say I'm missing something in here? How?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,29656,Oh, wait.  Wait, this is just where I'm supposed to go next.  Go back outside and do the monkey bars.  Holy shit!  Oh wait!  Okay.  These runs I can't use now.  I can just swap them out.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,29708,if  Murray was  an  IMP  by two  and  Can we chill?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,29749,Oh, I just pull everything.  the  reason what flavors of Gatorade
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,29784,for really did  the baiting  yellow, but casual drinking probably light blue  And then I actually like light blue and yellow mixed together.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,29817,The real answer is lime cucumber.  That one.  That is actually the most false answer in that confirms that you're definitely a Gatorade  Mona, which is correct.  What though I think it's disgusting?  Limon and Sabino.  I have an amazing half of my lekway to intake during the year this game.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,29847,Okay, let's go.  Oh, fucking cucumber.  It's absolutely disgusting.  I can't believe Mr. Mooten didn't use a super shotgun.  Holy shit.  How do you make it anywhere in this game?  What do you say about rum, what?  I thought I could eat.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,29870,Um, yellow is good, bro.  Yellow is right over there.  Nice try, guy.  You are not actively exercising for more than an hour.  You should just be drinking water.  If you're exercising in heat, excess of 75 degrees per year,
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,29889,then you have an excuse to drink Gatorade.  Other than that, players are drinking just excess sugar and sodium.  Umm, you really shouldn't drink it.  This is so good.  Look, I spend a lot of energy doing this.  Okay?  I- I got a ritual.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,29907,I'll never argue with you and your brother.  Okay.  Solidarity.  It's hard to hear the other people talking.  They're not talking about anything in point, don't I?  Something about Gatorade, guys.  Need a lot of sodium to kill. Yeah, you don't want to, like, fucking...
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,29938,Get, like, a cramp or anything, right?  Somebody said, did Big Water pay you to say that?  I wasted that thing.  Is there another fight out here later that I can come back and grab that or?  Oh, Slayer Gate.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,29956,Hello.  Yeah, they use powdered Gatorade for practices in games.  What the fuck is this?  So actually what I've been using since I've been in the pros is before practice, like  Like 20, 30 minutes before, there's a stuff called the right stuff.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,29978,And then I just drink that real quick.  And then during practice, I drink water,  and then I'll have one more right stuff in the middle of practice.  And it's like just a fuck ton of sodium, potassium, chloride, and some other shit.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,29995,It's like super constant, you can trade it and get it right, but without the sugar.  And then just water the rest of the time.  I feel like Gatorade is like the original like cheap feel, right?  Gamers, but I think I think the whole meme of Gatorade is that at the University of Florida like they it was so hot
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,30018,And they learned like how important it was to sweat and like what you released when you sweat  they basically reverse engineered what sweat was to get it back into your body  like that's the whole meme of like how like it's called Gatorade because the
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,30033,Florida University is Gatorade and so Gatorade pretty sure that's where the whole meme came from  Thanks  Oh.  Am I supposed to be able to get up there this way guys? Or do I need another...  You get it later? Oh.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,30064,wait power raid is trash that's on Coca-Cola  true  was there a lawsuit for power raid from Gatorade? they had to have been right  the names are too similar
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,30101,yeah the matrix some teams have like  post practice shakes for guys that need to gain weight  or guys that need to lose weight or  guys who have like  like certain needs  Like this summer when I was with the Giants,
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,30116,we had these sweat patches that they put on our thighs  before practice and practice the whole time.  And then they took these little patches off of us  and sent them to the lab.  And it basically told us like some guys
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,30131,release more potassium and sweat out more potassium  than others and like ice,  sweat out like a shit ton more chloride than potassium.  And I always used to cramp.  And I used to think it was because I lacked potassium.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,30144,but that little sweat patch thing actually  from the opposite.  And ever since I've been like supplementing more chloride  before workouts and practicing stuff a day,  almost never came.  I'm not even gonna do that.  Ew.  Ew.  Ew.  What the fuck?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,30161,Ew.  Ew.  Ew.  Ew.  Ew.  Ew.  Ew.  Ew.  Ew.  Ew.  Ew.  Ew.  five
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,30192,the  yet i still don't understand the whole chocolate milk after you work out  and  i don't think protein i don't think protein powder is like that expensive  compared to just  chocolate milk but  anything with a little extra protein is better than nothing.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,30225,We have a guy in high school come and talk to our team and say that you needed to drink like one of the small  Coca-Cola's like after you work out to like  Get your glycemic whatever  Back up and running. It sounded like bullshit then and it definitely sounds like bullshit
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,30244,This is the heart of the nest.  Wait, Buck, should I have gone over there?  thing  I think he can do training.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,30274,Thanks.  Cherry juice though after you work out.  That's the fucking one that helps so much with soreness.  And it has like a fuck ton of natural melatonin in it.  So you just work out and then you take like a fat ass like power long nap after you work out.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,30294,Oh no gun.  No no no I don't actually be him.  pickle Disney is the same thing as Gatorade and like the supplementing link for it. Holy
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,30326,shit that just did so much damage to me. I don't know what Gatorade jumps on. Oh like the little...  Ah, why is this a homing?  I'm not gonna lie, I don't even know what those guys do, okay?  And usually they die so fucking fast, I just don't even know.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,30352,I know that if you have really bad allergies, you consume local honey that's apparently supposed to help your allergies.  Like locally produced honey.  Oh, the Slayer key.  I used to live in a border town and I used to always just go across the border to Mexico to get like huge ass jars of honey for hella fucking cheap.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,30381,I mean, I would.  It's, I mean, I have horrible seasonal allergies.  So like the first thing I did when I came down to Florida was by local honey at Whole Foods.  And like if, if it's during like November is usually when I have like really bad sinus infections,
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,30402,if I just have like a spoonful of honey in the morning, during the times that I usually get like sinus infections,  like it usually wards it off actually pretty well. It might be placebo but ever  since I've heard about it I haven't really had that severe sign of infection.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,30426,So the idea with local honey is that if you move to Oklahoma from Michigan the  type of plants and the type of grasses and the type of flowers that are in  in Oklahoma compared to where you lived in Michigan.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,30439,The bees get the pollen from those plants and flowers,  and then they make the honey from that pollen.  And that apparently is supposed to give you  some sort of like allergic immunity to that shit.  If you are allergic to it, I don't know.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,30456,That's just what I think.  That's just what I think.  You're fearful cease to exist.  Honey and beer is godlike.  I never tried it.  Isn't that just considered need?  Well, need is like beer made out of.  Fuck.  Don't stand in here. Oh my god.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,30484,More like one.  Fuckin' dude. Fuck my shit up. Let's go.  Do your worst.  There it is.  The dg-g-min-maxers telling me that the honey meme doesn't work.  There I was looking for it.  I was looking for it.  Please stop spreading bro science.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,30521,Are you fucking kidding me?  How do you consume the honey? I literally just take a spoon for the ends of the game.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck. I'm out of ammo now.  Wait. You know what?  There's nothing better than just eating a spoonful of sugar in the morning, is there?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,30541,If I tell myself that it helps with allergies, and it does, then fuck you, YouTube!  I really want this one.  That's like me lifting almost my entire life and then I say, oh yeah, you know, I'm doing  like a five by five like deadlift thing, deadlift circuit like, you know, twice a week and,
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,30574,You know, it's helping my max quite a bit and then dgg people posting that like you know the optimal deadlifting practice is like  8 6 4 2  twice a week for six weeks and  You know someone who's never picked up a fucking parbell then their entire life on you how to live
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,30593,You now have access to the heart chamber  I need more armor and shit.  I need some enemies to kill.  That's not damaging me while I'm in here, right?  It wouldn't be that fucking stupid, right?  Okay.  I need to do from the behind.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,30627,Mr. Cool sponger late to the parade buddy.  Oh my god.  That's behind.  Okay then I need to do one from the front and then we're done.  Kind of waves. Can I ask you about your dirty debate tactics that you use on everybody?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,30658,Why do you think bringing in facts and logic and hypotheticals and new argument is... ...that's gold in any way?  Fuck!  He literally has no fucking answer for me.  What a disgusting piece of shit Neil lived fuck.  Who gets gallops and oh
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,30681,Disgusting actually go on Tyler you're really showing him I know he can't even fucking answer me  He's fucking shaking in his boots because he's just got called the fuck out. Hope Pixies listening  Okay, what if I use the challenge to refill my ammo

XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,31516,Let's go baby.  I guess I'm supposed to remember where that is but okay.  a
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,31549,late is this right.  You see in this thing going on. Yeah, they just asked me to moderate  I wanted to finish my doom run tonight.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,31595,Oh, kind of unfair if there's gonna be a 2v1 ram and Xe versus my best  The fuck am I supposed to be able to get over there?  and  of
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,31630,death  I think I make it all the way over there.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,31673,shit she's in.  Yes.  Where are we debating?  I have just a couple of sessions.  Debating.  Three years.  So, my first question is  Do you believe in objectivity at all?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,31704,Do you believe that something is objectivity exists at all?  Um, like outside of moral claims, yeah.  Try.  Oh.  Okay.  So that's the first thing that I guess I wanted to understand.  This sounds like a really weird question, but why?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,31732,So, all right, so it depends on what we mean by objectivity.  What's our working definition with objectivity?  You want to define it for me?  I want you to define it, actually, because I'm not sure what you mean by it.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,31746,So I want you to tell me what is objectivity to you.  Okay, so objectivity, and from my understanding, is something that we can prove to be objectively  true through observation of the real world, right?  Okay.  I have a problem with this kind of.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,31769,If you believe that all moral, okay, let me ask another question.  Do you believe all moral claims are essentially subjective because  Because you believe that they come back down to how we perceive them  It's not but it's not just about perception, but yeah, I think all moral claims are subjective. Yeah, what do you mean by not just perception? What else?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,31795,I think that moral claims are based off of what you choose to value, right?  So they're based off of that.  Do you have a statement to have truth value?  Do moral statements have truth value?  No?  Wait, all right.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,31813,So can you define truth value?  Like, what do you mean by that?  You define it ultimately because if-  What the fuck is this game?  Well, no, no.  If you think that they are true in any sort of way,
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,31827,of way, I'd be curious to hear what or I'm just trying to see if you think that moral  statements are just like an emotional expression.  So when I say you shouldn't kill a dog, that's just me expressing my emotional desire not
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,31842,to see that dog die, for example.  That was the impression I got of your notion of morality is that moral statements are just  my personal expressions of my values and how I feel about something.  But they aren't true in any meaningful way.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,31859,Give me Sagoonath's sleep, Stony.  Okay, so you would say that they don't have a truth value then in that?  Zero truth value.  Okay, so let me then ask this.  The statement like, wait, wait, wait, I thought I was debating Pixley.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,31875,What's going on?  Well, Ramen, me have the same opinion and you said like, okay, two versus one, but that's  okay.  So you were baiting me hard on Twitter. What's the issue?  Rem, this is not the baiting you.  I had no interest in talking to you, Rem.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,31891,Yeah.  Never did.  Wait.  You just, OK.  I thought that you did because I asked.  Look, Rem can sit here and like, spectate if he wants.  He can chime in when he thinks it's relevant.  Oh, if you're too scared to bait,
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,31905,that's fine.  But I'm here to debate you, P.A.  My waves.  That's OK.  OK.  I'll thank you afterwards.  How about that?  Sure.  You can have the sloppy seconds, Rem.  I have a question.  So you don't believe that moral statements have to value.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,31917,You think that they're just a form of expression  of expressing your feelings, right?  It's not just about feelings to me.  It's about values, what we choose to value.  And you do not believe that we can create,  or yeah moral statements are about things that we ought to do right you agree with
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,31944,that statement and you think if you're making a moral claim that is that is  definitionally like an odd claim right yes so moral statements are we what we  ought to do if you believe you believe there's no way that we can find a
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,31963,a reality within there, an objective reality within what we ought to do.  Right?  Um, so it depends what you mean by that. What do you mean?  I literally mean that. You believe that there's no way to find an objective answer
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,31981,and objective reality within the question what we ought to do.  So, like, so what do you mean? So like the claim itself or like the conclusion that you're making?  Like I'm not sure where you're going with that. Like could you give me an example?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32003,Well if I say humans ought to be kind to each other, you feel like there's no way to objectively prove that.  Well, I would say that the claim itself can't be proven objectively true, but if we accept  that claim, right, if we accept that moral ought, then we can use like data and observations
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32026,of the real world to make claims about like what's the best way to go about doing that.  So you believe that we can create frameworks and we can have an objective  truth within these frameworks.  So like, okay, so if I was to say that like, so if I was to make the moral claim
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32054,that murder, we should, we ought not murder, right?  that statement in and of itself is not objective in any way.  But if we accept it to be true, we can make objective claims  on how to go about that moral odd.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32081,Okay, so my main problem is if you believe that this is all ultimately subjective, I  do not understand how you can believe in an objective reality, right?  Like this whole idea is that, oh, since it's essentially starting from, you know, a human
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32105,perspective, it is essentially subjective.  But to me, when I hear that sentence, I think, well, you can apply that for anything.  Literally the moon, the stars, what I see in front of me, my computer must first be perceived
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32123,through me.  A subjective being who has subjective thoughts, my perception is subjective.  So I do not possibly understand how you can believe in an objective reality if it must  first go through this subjective perception.  So, there's a term for this.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32145,What's the name of it?  Like the idea that the only thing that you can know to be true is that you're experiencing  solipsism.  Solipsism, yeah.  So, I don't know where my position lies on  solipsism. I think that obviously our perception is flawed so that the way
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32168,that we look through the universe can be flawed oftentimes is but I think that  despite despite like the human errors in observation we can still make  objective claims about the universe through other means like I don't know  Science math is like logical statements like two plus two equals four shit like that, right?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32193,Um, I perhaps agree with you on logical statements  but when you say things like  Like science math all these things that we um that we measure still must go through our human perception first  It basically goes to the whole we might be in an AI
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32212,simulation argument. There's literally no way to prove that it's not just  that our perception is reality. So when you make statements like, oh you know  objective reality is a thing because we can measure it because we can look at
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32233,outside forces. I hate to answer that with the wall, then there is no real  outside force that you can prove beyond what your human perception is. Now if you say, whoa.  Okay, so maybe I'll modify my statement. So I do believe that science can't really, like,
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32251,even though we can say that gravity exists, for instance, because of, you know, the physics  behind it, etc. Doesn't mean that like we know that to be like objectively true. Like, I think  I think that science is an approximation to truth, not an absolute truth, if that makes sense.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32272,Well, I don't feel like that makes sense, because what would make it an approximation  than just nothing?  Because, you know, how can you say, oh, this is approximately to the truth when, in reality,  we might just all be part of a giant AI.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32287,That doesn't seem to make sense.  Well, exactly.  This is why I think that solipsism is really dumb.  Like, even if we accept solosism, if we acted as rational beings under the sort of assumption  that if we operated as solipsis from day to day, society would crumble, right?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32309,Like we have to believe that we are experiencing something that is objective, to be able to  have any sort of meaningful experience or meaningful interaction with other people  and stuff like that, right?  So then you believe that even though something is within our perception,
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32330,you can still find truth within it.  You should clarify by what you mean by true.  It's important.  Right, exactly.  Well, I guess reality.  Huh?  We can find reality within it.  Or we should not treat it any differently than what reality might be.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32348,Might as well just think that-  What do you mean by reality?  How do you determine what is reality?  Well, I would argue that our reality would be the experiences that we have in the world.  Well, so we can experience something that nobody else experiences, right?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32367,Like a schizophrenic can have delusions and hallucinations.  That doesn't mean that those hallucinations are true,  or objectively exist, right?  That's an absolutely true point.  So how would you define truth?  How would I define truth?  I'm not sure I believe in absolute truths.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32396,OK, so then why would you believe in any truth, period,  if it all might be false.  Because I think that there's utility and agreeing on something as being true,  like socially, society, right?  But to me, that's confusing, right?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32420,So you're agreeing on something that's true, even though it isn't true.  Or it might not be.  Because there's utility in that.  Like, you guys should define what you both mean when you say true.  It sounds really pedantic, but like this is kind of what you're.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32431,true. Yeah, so like how do you discover truth other than whatever you  subjectively experience? Well that's the point that I'm trying to make that if  you believe that there's like two layers of belief here I guess you have the
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32452,belief that even though we filter reality through our perceptions it  it doesn't make it invalid automatically,  just because it's through a perception  does not make it an invalid treatment.  Sure, absolutely.  But it doesn't make it objectively true.  All right, like.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32474,I mean, not all the time,  there's exceptions for sure.  Like what?  But that, well, like the schizophrenic example you gave.  However, until we're given evidence to point otherwise that our reality is false, we might as well not treat it that way.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32494,Do you understand what I'm saying?  So, until we are given evidence otherwise that our perceptions are false,  We should not treat it as we should not treat it as false or we should not treat it as false.  Sorry.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32521,So we should accept things to be true unless proven false is what you're saying.  Unless given evidence otherwise.  Yes.  So okay.  Okay.  I think we lost in the weeds here a bit.  Yeah, I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm trying to tie this back to the original dispute and I'm not sure.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32546,I mean, I can see exactly where Pixie's trying to go.  It's just it's hard to.  I can rope Rem and take my hand and walk me through it.  Well, no, because, well, Pixie's giving a different argument than I would, right?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32569,Pixie's giving an epistemic argument.  So reading chat, I mean, the casual sexism saying, you know, that I'm PMing here and  stuff is quite interesting because the argument that Pixie's giving right now is one that  I'm familiar with, but not one that I've ever actually given.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32585,I wouldn't say as necessarily a sexist argument.  You guys were talking right before the conversation.  conversation. I think it's a reasonable to assume that some information showing has happened, right?  There's a training article in there.  No, but it might be a bit. No.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32597,You can look at the argument that he's giving it now.  I was watching it. Why?  I don't know.  All right. It doesn't matter. This is really doesn't matter.  Can I try discussing with you, Mike, where if that's okay?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32611,I mean, yeah, I can pick up my argument afterwards as long as I have no children down for it.  You're fine.  Hit me with it, Rem.  So I noticed in your discussion, you said, Syllipsism is wrong because of the bad effects
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32628,of it, right?  Like if everyone were to be Syllipsis, then you know, society wouldn't have a coherent  society.  Yeah.  Right.  you are invoking morality as a reputation of slipsism.  You're begging the question.  Yeah, that we ought not be solips or act like solipsists because of the implications.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32652,So you acknowledge that absolutely everything is ultimately nothing has truth value.  Because if moral statements don't have truth value, as you said, then nothing has truth value.  True.  So you're complete nihilist about everything.  You are the ultimate skeptic.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32668,And if we work within your framework,  I could flip a coin right now.  And if I get heads, then you're wrong about everything.  Sure.  But like, this is the thing is that I think that  it's called lazy.  This is called being lazy in philosophy.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32685,No, no.  You reject everything.  You don't make a single positive claim.  There's not a single positive claim  that you could possibly make right now.  You've literally dug yourself into a hole.  Well, no, I can't.  And there's something that you can say.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32697,No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,  this is the thing is that I can make moral claims.  Yeah. Right?  But I can't prove my moral claims to be objectively true.  But you could, same thing with two plus two equals four
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32707,under this, because if nothing is true,  then I can say that two plus two equals three  and you have no way to refute the otherwise.  Sure, and it could, if we all accepted that it is,  But even that statement itself.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32721,Kurt Chuck Norris, wait, which free life in the building with a heart was?  Can you describe it more?  The same thing you just made has a truth value.  What do you mean?  Your statement that, you know, it possibly could be three or that that
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32735,itself has a truth value.  Any statement that you give to me right now  doesn't have a truth value.  There was no truth.  Yeah.  Why do you value?  Like, why do we have to have a truth value?  Why do we have to be able to prove something to be objectively true in order to make moral claims?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32750,I don't know.  That'd be true.  I assume you understand me, right?  Like, we are capable of communicating with each other.  There is meaning to the things that we say, right?  Like the words that I'm using, you understand.  Sure, but they're only because we both have come to a, like a subject.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32771,I have to say that.  How can you say that if there is, if nothing has a truth value?  How can you make these claims about the social makeup?  Well, I believe it to be true.  How can you say that you believe it to be true,
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32782,that it self-requites the truth statement as well?  That requires the truth value to say  that you believe something.  So this is what I'm trying to show,  is that your position leads to complete absurdity,  because everything that you possibly say
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32794,doesn't have a truth value,  including the fact that nothing is a truth value.  It's self-refuted, it's a complete absurdity,  and it's lazy philosophy.  anyone can do this. My grand can do this. So how do you dig yourself out of the hole?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32813,You don't? Right. Well, you know, if you want to acknowledge that, you know,  absolutely everybody, you know, everything that everyone says has no truth value, Nazis are  ultimately just as legitimate as, you know, a Democrat, you have no way to refute that.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32831,2 plus 2 equals 3 that's fine 2 plus 2 equals 97. That's fine. I mean, I'm not a neo nazi a neo nazi isn't a like like like yeah  I absolutely like  So this is the misunderstanding I'm having here is I don't understand how like
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32849,Okay, so even if we can't true even if we can't prove without it without a doubt  that something is objectively true.  Why is it flawed logic to say  that we can't make moral claims?  Because that statement, the statement that you make
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32870,when you say that we can't make,  like literally the statement,  moral statements don't have truth about you.  That is a claim that you make, right?  That's a true or false claim, but nothing is true.  So your own claim is false.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32885,So you've refuted yourself.  Well, no, it's true.  So what do you mean?  Is there true?  Is there not truth?  Well, it can happen both ways.  So one of the things that's kind of fusing here is that.  Is there subjective truth or objective truth or absolute truth?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32901,Yeah.  So one of the things that you're getting really hung up on  is that REM will conflate what you mean by true  into 15 million different things that are wrong.  No, no, no, no, because what you're doing,  when you say it's something true, like,
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32912,did Harry kill Voldemort?  Is that true?  well kind of but is objectively true like you're using your conflating like 15  different definitions of true together I asked him to do it under any sense of  truth that he wants this remains
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32924,yes  yeah but you can still have a meaningful conversation is my name is not capable  of  defending his own claim sorry I can't really talk  you can't really bring up my I can go back to my argument if you want I have
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32939,it waiting yeah wait he's doing a different argument than I am yeah but I  think that he's argument is more fruitful because your argument convinces  literally nobody.  Like the definition of morality that you use,  nobody on the face of the earth,
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32948,even as it says, even people.  Yeah, because he's working with more conventional  definitions, even in the literature,  nobody refers to morality the way that you do.  The idea that every single  religious statement is morality.  Just what I said.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32957,Then bring in Marty.  Marty is, I've talked to Marty about this before.  Like your idea that like,  well, morality is just all normativity,  all normativity is morality.  Nobody believes that.  Nobody uses that word like that.  If you were to be clear about that,
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32968,if you were to be clear about that,  two mind waves,  mind was to probably agree.  Oh, well, sure.  Every single normative thing ever requires morality.  I guess that type of morality exists, but that's not the type of morality he's talking about. We're talking about like good or evil
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32977,That's it not normativity period. What is what does it mean for something to be good destiny?  All right, well, I guess it depends on who you ask. That's a deep meta ethics question my dude  What is good  Wikipedia we can figure out what good is like just any context of good whatever you want to define it as if something is good
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,32997,Wait, hold on. I know that you did it in the middle of a philosophy discussion  Just appeal to a dictionary definition of good when this is literally like okay, because it was incredibly fucking stupid  Say them when that's literally like like the idea of what is goodness is like what all the methods is about like
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33014,How are you gonna say here ask me like well? I dictionary it like  The right movie doesn't the reason why I say let's consult dictionary is because good is by definition  We can analyze the concept of good and it'll come out as different is the definition objectively tonight
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33030,But I was gonna say ultimately no matter how we analyze goodness. It's always related to what we ought to do  Just by definition you can't have something be good and then not also have a moral imperative  But the thing is you're conflating two different types of ach that no one else in the world does
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33047,What are the two different types of achs that there is a most people recognize as a fundamental difference between like you ought not murder someone  Or you ought to treat your neighbor kindly versus you ought to fill a cup a ten liter cup five leaders in order to fill it halfway
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33060,Full that normative statement that moral statement are too fundamentally different things what I just am more than happy to have this discussion with you  Because we've talked about this many times. Yeah, and this is  Well, you're not talking to my words
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33071,You're just here to ambush him with philosophy questions. You know that he can't answer in order to make a point  You're not interested the conversation at all if he's not capable of having the discussion then fine  But I will know this okay rem there's a difference between having being able to have the conversation and asking you to walk
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33085,We can have it as we can have it as I've never looked I'll define as many churches you want my waves  One one we can I asked well I asked you to find true  Absolutely, I can do any any sense of truth that you want we could define it as correspondence
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33097,We could say that's up wait through if it only if the course  Wait rem are you on Wikipedia?  Okay, hold on hold on when you say correspondence. I have no idea  Of truth  No, it's way more complicated. This is like you're fucked
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33114,Yeah, this is the issue right my you're not capable of having a discussion so destiny has to come in here and  Okay, but like he's probably not capable of having like this level of ethics  It's like most people aren't right look I this is why I talked to pixie though
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33128,But Pity's not as familiar with meta-ethical literature as I am, right?  Sure, but the problem between these two was never-  I just like the next question.  My fundamental- this is what I'm talking about with Pity- these types of discussions are
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33141,not at all conducive to Twitch, right?  They aren't, and I think it's highly ridiculous for someone like Mindwaves, who doesn't know  anything about the subject, to be discussing it or to be calling people out and acting  smug like they know absolutely the more-
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33156,Did you say the same thing about Pixie?  Or anybody else besides you?  What do you mean?  I think it's pretty clear.  I think it's pretty decimable of discussing that.  Yeah, I mean, not as much as someone like Marty is, right?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33173,Pixie has studied.  I just had a conversation about this with Pixie,  and we were able to converse about it.  She wasn't as familiar with the literature as I was,  and I think that, frankly, the way  that she discussed it with you was not great.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33185,She knows that.  She knows that I think that that whole discussion well sure so the whole point was just for them to have another discussion about it  Where they're both treating each other like human beings  They're trying to like mineways dunking on pixi or people screaming at each other or whatever, right?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33197,but  at the end of the day mind waves doesn't know what the fuck is going on and  Peter does pixi no, yeah, I was gonna say what the fuck are you talking about Rem?  Wait wait wait wait I
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33209,Okay, two things first of all when it comes to the whole thing of like oh  Oh, Rem is like white knighting,  he's sending like messages about what?  It's a different.  Oh god, nobody.  What do you mean nobody?  I just call that one.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33222,Literally everyone in DJ, I've gotten PM's on Disney.  Why are you looking at Chad during this debate?  Like that's the number one mistake of a debate.  What the fuck?  Okay, hold on, wait, wait, wait.  I'm calling him more time on this.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33233,Okay, listen, I think that Pixie and Mine Waves  can have a discussion and that those two  should have a discussion and it shouldn't be,  Here is Ram to ask mindwaves what his theory of truth is  Acknowledge mindwaves isn't capable of having them. Yeah, but nobody is capable of having I'm not capable of having this discussion at this level
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33255,100% why are we having this because whether or not you're capable of having it people still have some notion of what is true  People still have some notion of what is good even if that I've studied philosopher  There's literally should should only people that have a degree in philosophy engage in philosophy
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33268,In front of thousands of thousands of people were the outcome of a decision that  Of a position that you take in this  In this field is going to influence people in the way that they interact with the world. No, I've been somebody to be a moral anti-realist
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33282,I could you imagine what damage they could do in society?  Oh my god, that would be terrifying  And the fact that you are incapable of defending yourself against that is the primary issue  You think that my claim about moral anti-realism is ridiculous and yet when push comes to shove
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33298,You can't defend your position for shit not again. So really of course not but that's what matters if you are going to go on a platform  And say absolutely that my position is true or not  You should be able to fucking defend it against someone who actually knows what they're talking about
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33311,This is why flat earthers should not be platformed on twitch  The same whether it's true or not because you don't believe in truth apparently okay  Can can so are they not allowed to have a discussion are you here to to police my
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33331,Discussion, okay, I'm just saying that I think it's irresponsible the platform someone okay  I accept listen  I'm gonna go ahead and accept the fallout from anybody in chat get it taking a different epistemic approach to morality  Okay, I will bear that brunt of that responsibility. Okay. I'm yes
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33345,I am brave just fine  And as long as you acknowledge that mind waves is not capable of discussing the subject with anyone who has read something on the matter  Yeah, of course not either, but sure  Yeah, she's the literal equivalent of a flat earth there. No, I don't think it is the literally literally quibble of the flat Arthur
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33362,Because I think that there's a difference in terms of what level of engagement you need to have with a subject  Okay, there's a difference between like the level of engagement that you need with the subject to make that claim that like
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33374,Whether or not you are a flat earth there is pretty easy to figure out whether or not you should be most reasonable people  We can expect should have access to the information not be flat other whether or not you can have a detailed conversation
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33384,about epistemology and meta epistemology and ethics is that's like a whole other different ballpark  But I agree actually I think what's required to have a discussion  No matter ethics is a lot higher. Yeah, of course  But I think the stakes are a bit lower when it comes to that I would disagree
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33401,Well, that's because you think philosophy is like the number one issue in the fucking world  You think it is single most important thing ever. Yeah, and I disagree  It's really that nobody should about moral philosophy in their day-to-day life
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33411,You can keep going in circles. I mean, I think even destiny would disagree with you because at the fundamental root of what you just said is a philosophical claim  The claim of a what is important and what it's not is itself philosophical the thing is is that people can practice philosophy without knowing
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33425,Anything about it. That's the whole point. That's the whole I can practice science without knowing anything about it  It's a lot harder to do that. It's a lot. No, it's a lot harder to do don't even grant that not every person can walk into a car factory and start making
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33437,Yeah, you can practice madly. You want sure? Yeah, absolutely  But we're not going to listen to someone who has never read a calculus textbook instead  We'll talk to people who have actually studied mathematics instead of someone who has the equivalent of a first-grader in mathematics
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33449,Yeah, but with the mathematic claims aren't things that we're general because mathematical claims aren't things that are usually relevant to our everyday lives  Like we they're not like hotly contested in the same way that like ethical claims are
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33459,What do you mean we use that every single day of our lives? Okay?  I can see the whole argument you're right nobody except for literally the most studied philosophers of all time by the way  This excludes you because you're still just an undergrad so even you're irresponsibly engaged in this conversation here
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33472,Okay, so there you go. No one is allowed to have it. I take  To be on that side agree  Now let pixie in mind waves let them just have their  Responsive that I actually agree with you on a lot of subjects on the topic of like the companion guilt argument
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33489,I feel confident enough in having read most of the literature in that area just discuss it with almost  I feel confident not having read a single fucking book.  There we go.  OK, that's me.  But in respect to almost every other area of philosophy,
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33502,you're right.  I don't make positive claims in those areas.  And you know that I don't talk about almost every other area  of philosophy except for ones I've actually read a lot in.  That's that's literally something I talk about all the time.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33513,So that claims like obviously I agree with you.  OK, cool.  All right.  Can pick see in my ways.  I got a wonderful discussion now.  Okay, hold on wait firstly can we just all everybody just take a deep breath have a little reset, okay?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33531,Are we all okay everybody feels okay? I need to hear  verbal  Confirmation for both of you guys are both doing okay  Pixie  Okay, mind waves. Yes. I need I need to hear it a little bit more jovially  Yes
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33549,Okay, good enough. Okay, go.  Okay. So I'm going, I'm going to, I don't want to be too slow on this, but I just really  want to make sure that we have our basics together. So again, you believe in objective reality? Yes or no?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33570,What do you mean by objective reality? Well, I'm using the definition that you use that  things that can be measured outside of us. Unless I will use whatever definition of objective  reality you want to use. Okay, let's all come to an agreement. When we say objective reality,
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33591,what do you guys mean? Mind waves? What is your idea of an objective reality? Or I can suggest a  definition and you guys could tell me if you agree or disagree, we go from there. I will use  whatever definition you guys want to use. Okay, here's all put forth my definition of objective
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33605,to reality, mind means you can accept to reject it  or modify it, okay?  So I, when someone says objective reality to me,  what I'm thinking is that if every single human being  would disappear, this is a feature of the world
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33616,that would still exist.  All humans could go away and this thing would exist  independent of the conception of any human.  So like a mountain, one might argue,  if all humans disappear, that mountain is still there  and it will always be there because it's a feature
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33628,of the world, it's objective reality.  And that's a knowable thing, whatever.  This is, that's what I would say is objective reality.  agree or disagree with that. Yeah, yeah, it's true outside the observation of humans. Okay,  let's okay, that's his definition of objective morality then. Okay, so you see my problem with
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33646,that is that that's a claim that we can actually never know because all the information we ever  have and we will ever gain is through our own perception. Well, doesn't that defeat your  your argument that you can ever make an objective claim about anything?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33665,Wouldn't that mean everything's subjective?  Wait, careful. So, hold on. Wait, real quick, just to clarify.  So she didn't say that. She said you said that, right?  She does believe that things are knowable, I believe, right?  Because she would be the realest.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33675,So she's asking you if you don't think you could know  if there's an objective reality or whatever,  how can you say anything about anything?  Does that make sense? Sorry, that was kind of crazy.  Yeah. I mean, sure. If we accept the fact that, you know,
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33688,the human experience is flawed,  that we have no way of being able to observe things  without experiencing them first.  Sure, we can't know things to be objectively true then.  Yeah.  Okay.  But yet you think that this has,  or that we shouldn't live with this mind frame
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33709,or work with this mind frame,  because essentially it would mean  that our whole life is subjective  and we shouldn't treat anything as true.  to something like, oh, the moon is made out of cheese.  Wouldn't even be like, wouldn't be even a statement
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33725,that we could say as false,  because, hey, everything's a marked perception.  And we have no way of proving something  outside of our perception.  Well, no, because my perception, my understanding,  my experience with cheese, I know with that,  like to me, I know what that is, right?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33743,We can go ahead and through observational skills,  look at the moon, observe what,  like what the surface of the moon actually consists of,  and we can say, all right,  this isn't the same as what I know cheese to be.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33756,But the point that I'm trying to make here  is that since at the end of the day,  it's something through your perception,  there is actually no way for you to claim  that the moon actually isn't cheese.  Like, it's just literally an impossible thing to do.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33771,objectively, like absolutely sure.  But you still agree that it's kind of useless to view life like that.  We don't gain anything from that.  Yeah, it is useless to be hyper skeptical of every single perception about the observable universe.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33792,Yeah.  Okay. Okay.  Good.  There's no utility in that.  Yeah.  So yeah, I'm really happy you agree with that.  So why?  Well, I'm about to explain.  OK.  So when it comes to morality,  we can argue or what you were arguing is that ultimately,
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33819,if you trace it back long enough, it ends up with claims  that are a result of perception.  Wait, I'm sorry, I fixed it.  You repeat that more time?  The Vega was talking about going so far.  That when we were talking about it the other day, your argument about everything, about
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33842,morality being subjective is that ultimately it's because it comes from human perception.  That what comes from human perception?  Ourality.  I mean it must.  It must.  Where else does it come from?  Okay, okay.  So, I just don't understand that if you agree that, you know, perhaps there isn't an objective
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33879,reality, but it doesn't make sense to view the world through that lens. So we might as well  act as if we have an objective reality and work towards finding those truths in the universe,  even though it's technically, you know, it might technically be all subjective.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33897,I do not understand why we cannot do that with morality.  because we because you can't like how could you okay so hold on so what we  yeah and you did so what pixie saying is that what what pixie saying is that do
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33915,you believe the moon is any more real than goodness because what because the  net the question yeah so the next question from that is going to be if you  say I imagine you would say well yeah I think the moon is more real than goodness
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33927,can be so pixie is going to ask you okay well if you think that you're  filtering things through your subjective human experience you can't truly know  if the moon is real but you treat it as though it's real why can't we do
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33937,something similar with a concept like morality  um because I don't think that you can uh well okay so because there's observations  we can make about the moon there's there's ways that we can um like we we have  methods to be able to like prove that it does exist based on what do you mean by
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33957,I proved it.  Understanding of the...  Well, we can observe that there is a celestial body hovering around the earth, right?  We can observe that.  We can observe a number of other different factors about the moon, right?  Sure, that's fair.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33974,And we can say that these observations exist, right?  Whether or not it objectively exists outside of how I'm experiencing them, I feel like  is a different, like question, right?  But like, as long as we all agree  that we are experiencing the same thing
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,33990,that we're observing the same thing,  we can say that this is subjectively true  based on our collective experience  or understanding or observations about this moon, right?  So I don't understand why you can't make the same thing  with morality.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34009,Well, how would you?  well, we can say, hey, or that's where we create frameworks where we agree within, right?  And we say that there's truth within those frameworks.  So let's take Kantian or the theology, for example, we create a framework that humans
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34029,ought to have a duty to each other and we ought to operate within that framework.  within that we can find a supposed like objective truth. Now technically you're aren't aren't  you already making an odd claim that we should we should look through this specific type of lens.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34050,Well yes but the point that I'm well how do you how do you how do you prove that that  odd claim is objectively true though. Well that's why I'm going to the illusion.  So this is a thing. Even though you could technically make the claim, hey, you know what?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34067,Like this whole framework at the end of the day, it goes back to, oh, because I feel like  that's good. Or I feel like it should be that way. Because of your human subjective  experience, you could still make that argument with literally anything else in reality. But
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34088,But if we agree that, hey, you know what, that's not a very valuable way to go through  the world and it doesn't really create any new knowledge or useful information.  We might as well try to study it.  We might as well try to find the data about it and then create these frameworks that we
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34110,use to interpret reality.  So I'm saying you can do the same exact thing with morality.  So just like how you can argue that technically your perception of the moon is a subjective  experience, we still do not act that way because it brings no value.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34136,Okay, so sure, but like, okay, so if your argument is that we can...  So you're saying that like we can...  If we assume a certain sort of ethical framework to work within,  then we can make truth claims based off of that framework that we lay out.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34157,Is that what you're saying?  I believe so.  Okay, so you're presupposing that that framework that we're working in is  objective. I'm presupposing that you can objectively get if you work within that  framework there are other objective truths that you can get with it within
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34179,it and I know that's very confusing so well I don't think it's very  confusing I think I understood what you meant. But the thing is is that you're  You're already presupposing that the framework that you're you're working in is objective, right?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34195,Which which you're you're choosing to work within a framework based on your subjective evaluation.  Just like any science or any way that we interact with.  Exactly. So ultimately, morality depends on what framework that you're choosing to work in,
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34214,Well, a little more than our reality itself, that's the argument that I'm trying to make,  that you can be technical about it and say, hey, you know what, technically the moon  is also a subjective experience, but it does not- I mean it is.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34233,Yeah, but you even admitted it yourself that it doesn't make sense to actually view the  world in that light, so we might as well not treat it that way.  true so we we make arguments for why my observation of the moon is correct and we come together
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34247,societally collectively and we agree on a certain definition a certain observation of the moon  we we agree that there is truth in it together right that doesn't mean that like everything that  all that doesn't mean that all those claims are objectively true just like just because you choose
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34264,the work within a moral framework even if everybody like agrees to it doesn't mean that that framework  is objectively true.  So I don't think you got the first message that I was trying to say.  Alright, hold on, I got a P really bad.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34279,Can you give me like two minutes?  Yeah, I'll go for it.  One second.  Okay, now I'm gonna start talking mind- what?  No, I'm joking.  You fucking girlfriend.  Oh shit, you fucked up.  Destiny, you heard the fucking auto-currant that you got?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34293,Why, dude, I'm fucking- this shotgun is gods, didn't you, dude?  the auto for it.  Yeah, I'm sure you do you a little cook.  Rem was being super comfy.  Rem was not being calm.  Rem was just in here to dunk on fucking mind waves.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34316,And after mind waves conversation with Pixie yesterday,  all I did was I walked in and mind was I shouted in  and I'm saying there's no point in having conversations  or you're trying to dunk on somebody.  The only reason Rem was in here was to dunk on somebody.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34325,That's it. That's not a productive conversation.  Whether the people are like ultra well versed  on the material or not.  That's not really the point.  Okay.  What?  Ram wanting attention?  No, chill, stop.  Okay, what am I looking for?  Oh, okay, hold on.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34348,These challenges.  Overloading shield to the plasma vehicle 16.  Oh, it doesn't have to be at once.  Thank God.  and then just, oh, these are easy.  These are so easy.  15 parallards, kill these students  at some of the heat last 30 times.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34360,Just because in the back of his mind,  he would have liked to dunk on someone.  Doesn't mean the conversation in a vacuum  could have kept an up-intellectual on POGUS,  or POGUS, champus.  There is nothing intellectually honest about being like,
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34369,you're not qualifying how this debate,  irresponsible.  That is nothing new.  You're not having a conversation on the subject matter.  You're making it an ad-hum about the person's  qualifications of conversation.  If you want to have a broader conversation  about what is the responsibility to platform
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34381,like people over a certain level of knowledge,  That's fine, but like sitting here and shitting on somebody's credentials has nothing to do with like having a good conversation.  It's completely opposite. I'm sorry. Okay, you guys go.  All right.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34393,What's up?  So,  I was establishing before  if you agree that in our real world or that in our world,  we shouldn't treat it as just everything might be subjective.  There's no real way to interpret reality.  I do not understand why we cannot have the same position when it comes to morality.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34418,So I would say, well, you can pretend that your morals are objective,  but you can't prove them to be so, right?  So...  And I don't think that there's any utility in pretending like your moral claims,  or any sort of moral claim is objectively true.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34442,Don't you think there might be some utility in terms of being able to say like,  oh, like laws are based on real morals.  Don't you think there might be a little bit of like utility there?  Like for instance, if two people propose a law, one person says it ought to be legal to murder,
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34458,and another person says it ought not to be legal to murder.  There might be some utility in terms of like which law we craft  Well even then like you I don't think that you could make a  what  You can't make it like you can make an appeal towards like why murder is wrong
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34481,You can but like you can't like prove it to be objectively  So your definition for objectively true seems to be that it yielded some amount of utility.  So, Pixie is trying to draw parallels between like say physics and math, right?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34493,We could say that one plus one equals two.  We could say that one plus one equals three.  But it seems like both of you would agree that saying one plus one equals three is kind  of foolish even if we could because there's no utility there.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34503,So we agree that one plus one equals two.  So we choose like a framework that better suits us as humans.  And then we apply that.  We take math and we apply that through physics and then through chemistry and then through
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34512,engineering.  So Pixie's making a similar argument for morality, that we can agree that while murder  could be right, doesn't serve us much good, or murder could be wrong, now we have that  rule, now we can apply that through the framework of law and punishment, right, similar to how
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34525,we would take math and apply it through like physics and engineering.  So she's asking why these two things aren't comparable, what makes these fundamentally  different from one another?  I have no idea.  You can talk through it.  If you've never, so not many people go like this deep into like an ethics conversation,
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34554,but you can just start like thinking about, well, why does it feel different?  Why does one feel wrong?  Because obviously one feels wrong to you.  It must.  So that feeling either comports with some like idea or intuition that you have, which
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34565,ironically is where people say morality comes from.  Or are there some reasoning that you just have to think a little bit more about to figure out why you believe that to be true?  But yeah, that's...  Because, I mean, we can leave it here until you can find a reason.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34579,Well, hold on, because I know I actually don't know where we're at.  So, like, what is the question being proposed?  So, basically, you're saying what your claim was before was, hey, you know what, the reason why we treat the world as objective,
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34595,objective or even though it might technically theoretically not be is because it provides the utility and  I'm drawing and I'm basically saying the same thing can be applied to morality that we should not just treat it as  something fundamentally subjective
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34613,When it's not any more subjective than technically anything else in the world  No, I'm sorry  Okay, so the first thing is that we agreed to treat the world as, like, we agreed to  treat the world as if it has objective truths because it creates utility.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34638,And then the second claim is that we treat morality as being objective because it creates  utility.  Is that what we're saying?  Well, that's not necessarily what I personally believe.  I'd have to think a little bit more about that.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34651,But the point that I believe is,  since I personally don't see a difference  between the subjectivity of the world  and the subjectivity of morality,  I might as well treat them as objectively as possible.  I might as well just treat them as part of reality.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34668,So since you made this distinction between them  at utility, but then again,  how do you really not find any utility  within treating morality as a real thing?  Well, it depends on what you mean  by morality as a real thing.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34689,Like so I...  As a real, when she says a real thing,  she means as a real as you say, like, math or physics is.  That's what she means when she says real.  So whatever your definition of math and physics
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34698,would be being real, she would use that  to apply that to morality.  She wants to know why do you think physics or math  more real than some sort of like moral reasoning.  Right there, that's what I'm talking about.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34715,Get these motherfuckers out of here.  Sorry.  Kick an ass.  In my video game, sorry.  Um...  Who's the fucking auto turret?  Why?  Dude, this is kind of so good.  I'm so good.  It's really good to kill an auto turret.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34731,Okay, Dan.  I don't know.  I just think that like, because I think that all of this is like, I don't know.  I don't believe objective truth.  So like I, I, I, I, I mean, if you don't believe in objective truth, why make any claim of
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34755,anything ever?  Well, I mean, I guess I should say like, absolute truth.  I don't I don't know um fuck dude. I fucking hate philosophy. Um, let's see  It's okay to take it's okay to take a break here  I'll think about this more than I do this all the time especially with was because she was fucking confusing
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34777,But I think maybe I'm never gonna look this up because I really don't give a shit  Well, that's okay, but at the very least then we don't have to like be mean and sub tweet each other and say that we're fucking retarded to each other
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34787,right I never did that never I think you're arguing with the people that are  theologists that's kind of a like I didn't say that you hold on what was  doing arguing with the oh it feels like it okay so if I were to tell you that
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34814,Like you feel like a mean victims of con it sounds like whoa, why would you call me?  I was like why didn't say you were a mean victory? I said you feel like what?  There's a there no because that's a like a that's a value statement
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34824,I'm not I'm not applying a value statement to theist or fucking like moral realism  But there's a clear connotation there  Is there I kind of is right?  Something arguing with X is just like arguing with why when the purpose is to show that arguing with X is exhausting
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34840,And then why is he used to something that most people commonly understand to be something stupid like theology, right?  Sure  Yes, okay, you could take that yeah, you could take that away from that to each  Just say sorry bro. I'm not saying sorry fuck that shit. That's a bad issue
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34860,Good job Dan leading the way  Hey, Rams giving you some  I just, this whole argument feels bad because I feel like the entirety of the burden of proof is being put on me.  When I feel like when you're the one claiming objectivity, the burden of proof should be on you.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34875,Well, no, no. So she's not really claiming objectivity.  So I don't think she's actually made any positive claims at all, actually. We haven't even gotten to that part of the discussion.  The question is, is that how can you say like you believe like, if somebody were to come up to you and say like,
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34892,I think that math and physics and engineering,  I think those are all real objective reality, ever.  You probably wouldn't laugh at them and make fun of them.  But when somebody says morality, I think that's real  objective.  You'd be like, dude, you're so stupid.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34902,And then the question is, well, why do you feel that way  about morality, but not that way about things like math?  That's the question.  What's the difference?  And then teasing out that difference gets you the answer  of why you think that there's a fundamental difference
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34913,between reality, which is what you call physics and math,  versus morality.  Because Pixie is probably going to make the argument  that there is no difference between the two.  seems to be what she's getting at but right now she's trying to figure out why you think there's a
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34925,difference between the two it doesn't look like a really clear line of reasoning to explain why  yeah i'm not sure right that's something i would have to think about  go ahead because yeah basically i i see no difference between them so i just treat both of them as
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34951,you know, objective to me. Or I just treat them both as reality. That's, I guess, a better argument  or phrasing or words you use. Well, do you treat them as or do you genuinely believe them to be  objective? Well, to me, it doesn't matter if, oh, technically they're subjective or if technically
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34969,they're whatever, because it doesn't impact my life unless positively I guess, or it doesn't  really contribute anything. So I might as well treat both of them as reality.  But if you were to make a claim about do you think that like even though you treat it as
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,34989,being objectively true, like do you actually believe? Like I don't know I'm interested in your  in your answer. Well this is where I think we might fundamentally disagree because I think  human person yes I think because everything we experienced throughout our world is
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35006,through human perception that makes it value to us do you like do you know have  you ever read medications of first philosophy I haven't read anything in  philosophy okay fucking a boring have you heard of the car like that he's maybe
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35021,you heard of the car yeah cool so he's um he's famous famous phrase is  I think therefore I am.  Ha ha, good one Dan. Sorry.  So basically I know that you don't, you're not interested in this that much but I strongly
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35039,recommend reading it.  He basically poses this.  It's like 30 pages but go ahead.  Yeah, he basically poses this question of like, okay, what if there's an evil deceiver  out there who is just tricking us and tricking all our beliefs and like all our perceptions
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35056,of everything. Like what if that's actually the case, you know, and you can kind of replace  that with anything. What if you're a brain and a vat? What if we're in a simulation, whatever?  And he ultimately comes to the conclusion that what can never be deceived is technically
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35071,yourself. You think therefore you are. And I think somewhat like along those lines, I until I have  a strong reason for disbelief to basically not believe in the reality that I'm experiencing,  I might as well treat my reality as real.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35098,Okay. I mean, yeah, I agree with you. I agree with that statement. It wouldn't make any sense to  not right like yeah so I just because I see no distinction between the possible  perception the possible like reality and our perception I mean well I'm
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35121,basically just being actually organized it before so yeah since I don't see any  distinction I treat them both as if they are real.  It just doesn't feel like a satisfying answer. I'm not gonna lie.  Why talk to me? Why does it feel unsatisfying?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35146,You were on the right track earlier. What were you asking questions about?  but you're asking, you had some good-ask questions,  then you abandoned them.  I don't fucking know.  What was the good-ask question?  You tell me.  Shh.  That'd be cheating, wouldn't it?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35161,No, it would be cheating.  It just feels unsatisfactory because like,  it basically comes down to like,  oh, well, we can just claim anything  to be objectively true.  Well, including morality.  Like any morality claim can be objectively true  at that point, right?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35180,And then how do you just sparse between like differing  objective, differing like morality claims or moral claims?  Like, like, do you just say both are objectively true  because the person believes it to be or?  Well, this is why we create frameworks, right?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35196,Just as we create a framework to, I don't know,  to chemistry and measure scientific facts,  we attempt to do the same things with morality.  And it's been done throughout history  and frameworks have been broken down  when we find absurd scenes within them,
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35214,and they've been created again.  So one example of this is naturalism.  And it used to be a belief that a lot of people held,  and so it became basically absolute,  absolutely when its absurdities were pointed out.  So in naturalism, people believe that,
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35231,oh, what is in nature is what is good,  which is absolutely ridiculous, right?  like you can make the argument, well, there's animals that eat their babies in nature.  Does that mean that it's good for us to eat our babies?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35246,Because that's what you can find in nature.  Or, hey, phones don't exist in nature.  Should we not have phones?  So the idea that these frameworks can never be brought down isn't necessarily true.  But it's the idea that we can create logical frameworks where things are objectively true within it.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35266,if we don't, if we agree obviously on our definitions, just like how we would have to agree on like definitions or units of measurement for any science.  Yeah, so that sounds like, that sounds like subjectivity though, right? Like it's, it's true if we all, like if we come together and agree for it to be true.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35286,Well, the point is that you might as well treat it as objectivity, right?  Like it's...  Well, until somebody else comes with an opposing claim, right?  Yeah, just like science.  Something that's like indirect opposition of...  Yeah, just like science.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35300,Like, if you...  To me, you would either have two planes.  You'd either have two positions.  You either have the position while everything's subjective, so we might as well not believe  in anything at all because everything technically be subjective or...
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35313,Okay, like technically yes human perception there's no actually way to prove it  But we might as well treat it as reality aka like objective because that's only the way that's only way we can get meaning for results  So how do you choose your framework your moral framework
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35336,Well, I usually find a person's like values first  I obviously have my own value. Well you would I'm talking about yours not like others  So wait careful utilitarian doesn't really give us a statement on what your values are it just tells us kind of like how to
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35356,Apply said values right yeah, exactly  Which is the framework that I'm using so my values I value oh  like  What type of utilitarian then like  I don't know what you mean by that.  Mill.  So utilitarianism basically results to the greatest amount of good to the greatest amount
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35377,of people.  That's the very, very basic statement.  So Bentham and Mills talk about, and this is like two user example yesterday, the Coom  Machine.  It's a whole idea that all pleasure or human beings get pleasure from freedom.  And we should try to implement that throughout society because it leads to human happiness overall.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35407,And we should try to do what is the greatest amount of people.  So my values, I value human happiness a lot.  I value stability a lot.  Yeah, I, those are my values in line.  So I try to use a utilitarian framework to work with that.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35426,I try to say like, okay, does this, if I put this law, how many people are going to be  negatively affected by it and how many people are going to be positively affected by it?  And that's a framework I try to use.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35441,Sorry.  Sorry.  So why do you choose that framework though?  So like you said that you, because all I got from that was like what you choose to value.  You value stability and happiness.  Yes.  I mean, I'm not disagreeing that we all have values.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35460,But that really doesn't tell me very much about like how you like what your framework  is, right?  Like, we could all go about achieving happiness or stability quote unquote.  in like different ways, right?  So...  Let me see how I can explain this.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35478,If I use a utilitarian framework,  because my argument for using a utilitarian framework is,  well, if you value human happiness,  then we should do whatever can bring the most happiness to the most people.  So that's a framework, I'm going under.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35496,Now, let's say you don't value your happiness.  Well, you're saying that...  Just to...  Because you said that you're picking utilitarianism because we should try to bring happiness to as many people as possible.  The most happiness to the most people.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35508,Right?  But like that, you're describing what utilitarian is not why you pick that framework.  Well, no, I'm kind of...  Or maybe I don't know how else to explain it.  So I'm picking that framework by value human happiness.  And I believe that framework is the one that makes the most sense.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35527,if I value human happiness, I would want to do what's the greatest amount of good for the greatest amount of people.  Does that make sense or am I still being...  Yeah, so how do you prove... yeah, so how do you prove you utilitarian to be objective? Or are you just
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35549,gonna say that like, oh well we just... if we disagree on utilitarianism then it is objective.  Well, that's two, there's two things to say in there.  The first one is, again, you technically can't prove it objective, just like you can't
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35565,prove anything else in the world objective.  Right?  Um, now we can say it's a framework that makes sense and we should treat it as objective  because logically, if you value human happiness, you should do whatever we can.  Well, that's an odd claim in and of itself, right?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35583,So how do you prove that?  Right?  Well, it's an op claim in the sense  that I guess like we're creating these values to uphold.  But again, that's no freaking different  than picking your units and measurements in science  or picking what I guess like thermometer you're gonna use
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35604,or anything like that.  like it's it's just as valid as any of those things  i'd i'd  i feel like it's not  but like I don't know how to argue that it's not.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35639,Brian, thank you for the Twitch Prime.  That is objectively moral.  Thank you.  Yeah, I don't know.  this is something I would have to think about. I feel like you have proven that even the moral  framework that you work in is subjective. You're making a claim towards objectivity because you
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35671,find utility in claiming that it is objective, which I would argue doesn't necessarily mean it is  objective? Well the point is that basically the line gets so blurred or it  becomes like so meaningless to just say oh it's subjective. If you treat
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35689,everything as subjective then you basically you know you're the ultimate  skeptic nothing is real what's the difference between you staying in your  room all day and or talking to people or you know finding a new scientific  Discovery, there is none.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35710,So  as long as the only thing, I guess, that you can kind of 100%  prove goes back to like what Descartes said that you've you  think therefore you are. So as long as your experiences are  two and until you have some sort of, I guess, some sort of stimulus to prove
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35733,otherwise, you might as well just act as if it's reality.  Yes, quite. Yeah, all right, I think you've given me a lot to think about. Yeah, this  This is not satisfactory at all.  Like it doesn't feel very satisfying, but I feel like I get where you're coming from.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35763,I don't agree with your conclusions, fuck.  Umm...  Yeah, maybe we just have another conversation after I begrudgingly fucking read some philosophy.  I don't know.  Listen, I love getting other people motivated in philosophy and I know you don't like it.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35782,But there's beauty in it, okay?  Like think about it.  And that shit makes me want to like fucking I can't I can't even say it. Okay, it's fine  It'd be like that  Nick who knows but maybe you'll be gradually reading some philosophy you will get you something to like
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35800,Or maybe you find something that you find interesting within it  This is the problem is every time I've ever dived into fucking philosophy  Philosophy I never come away any smarter than I fucking started. I never know everything about philosophy right now
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35816,No, but like like I step like even when I did dive into it, right?  Like I felt like I came out of it. No, no more knowledgeable than I fucking started. I don't know  Yeah.  Um, what do you define happiness as?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35833,Fixing.  Oh, that's a really complicated question, right?  Oh, one hand.  So if I had to define happiness, it goes back to the idea of like, what's, what is it?  You can either create like a physical argument.  You can say like things like dopamine and serotonin.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35854,can talk about economic stability as well as physical stability. I think that there's  a lot of measures that we can use to try to measure happiness. I don't think it's  like for me I don't know a real way to measure individual human happiness other than asking
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35872,a person and hoping they're honest. But I think in a large scale when it comes to humans  in general, we do find patterns that repeat themselves when it comes to human happiness.  So like for example, we know mental illness, which we would classify as bad and caring for
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35893,society, that tends to rise a lot if you're homeless. So if you take that away, then theoretically  by virtue of just not having or not being at risk of mental illness, you're better and therefore  or I guess half year?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35913,Okay.  So yeah, I don't know how I personally define happiness.  I would say that like, we can, I think like you said,  we can look towards certain things in society  that we'd know creates happiness, generally speaking.  Things like, I think you pointed towards economic stability.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35934,You know,  I don't know, like social fucking interaction,  like I don't know, stuff like that, right?  But, all right.  Yeah, I don't think we disagree too much  on what is happiness.  But like when you say it's just dopamine, right?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35954,That's kind of like why I gave you  the coom machine hypothetical, right?  Yeah, I'll admit that I could've argued better  yesterday and I was just very heated because of the first statement that you  made and it just it all went downhill from there but I'm happy I was able to
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35972,explain myself there and that you gave me chance to tell me myself here so I  appreciate you. Yeah I I try not to be unsure if you feel like I ever am do  like, call me out. So yeah.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,35989,Wow, good job, guys. It's beautiful. How do you feel down?  Would being uncharitable be something like Rem saying that  Steven does the same thing as having antibiotics or talk about  their position in front of thousands? Or is that a good
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36002,example or no? It's just a Rem being mad. Don't run doing  Rem things. Are you fucking kidding me? How can I not make it  up there?  did you and  all right now takes Lehil's day to get from one
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36023,day to get left in from the you're in the land of the Alondon bench  argued that way, I would argue it through this way. And it was like, yeah, I think my argument  might be a little bit complicated. And, you know, we kept talking. And then when we came here,
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36039,I started my argument. And then he was like, Oh, I don't think that's the best argument to use,  which can be the case. Like, it's very, it's a difficult argument, kind of. But it's not like  I got it off him.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36051,I, um, like the reason why I guess like why I was so annoyed also and I kind of relate  to Ramen this, it's not, I have like mixed feelings now because of like how I was explaining  philosophy earlier.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36065,Because yeah, studying with stuff has helped me form more coherent arguments.  So when I have, so for example, like my dick heart, my dick heart example, um, there's  There's a lot of things that I would have to sometimes accept beforehand in order to make
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36082,a proper explanation that I might just completely miss because it's already in my head.  You know what I mean?  So I understand where I'm coming from that my argument might not necessarily be the  best one because you have to set it up a lot before and it was kind of slow.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36098,I mean I kept asking you questions and I kept, you know, it was like where the fuck are you  going here?  I'm glad I was able to do it.  and I was just fucking I don't give a shit about your conversation. I watched most of it so
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36115,All right, yeah, maybe yeah, maybe I'll I'll think about this a little bit and we'll come back  If I care enough to we'll see  Okay, I hope you have a good day. Thank you. Have fun with your stream, right?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36130,Wow for once again Dan, how do you feel?  There's one of this  If I may recommend it for you, Dan.  If I may recommend it for you,  if I may recommend it for you,  if I may recommend it for your goals to argue with people on the merits of philosophy,
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36150,I would recommend the publications of Tridicus by Ludwig Wixting.  It's only 75 pages and it's basic thesis.  This is philosophy is dumb.  We should stop doing it.  Nice.  True.  Any cherries?  Any sure is where they at?  Favorite flop
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36175,It is your goal  This is why I hate having philosophical debates is because like I go into this like and telling you guys  I don't know anything about philosophy and then like I walk away a little bit challenged on my ideas and you go
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36188,Oh my ways got blown the fuck out. I mean  like Jesus Christ, dude, come on, I have no ammo. Sorry. For  American Post purposes, mostly people are unfortunately typically more  interested in arguments and not discussions. So in theory, like you could
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36208,spend the entire time just calling Mr. Rem a nerd and that would have been as  equally as an effective argument as his were based on just the back of trying  the 51% of the audience to your side, which to be fair, I would have found the argument
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36222,that he is a nerd and to stop his study a valuable argument of point.  Regardless if you had said Ludwoo, Ludwoo, Wigman, seeing a nerd or not.  Fuck, I'm gonna have to stop seeing Trio after that conversation.  Said it weighed too many times.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36242,True.  Correct.  Correct  You weren't here in mind waves when we were in the fucking throws in Hawaii was fucking true every fucking two minutes  Oh  Stop I'm proud of that  straight  to  subjectively reporting
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36275,to  if  okay you  guy has  you being useful ammo YES  I went live just for fucking today.  Now I don't think that's what I'm saying.  Three publication.  Boom!  It's quite good.  There's even a good audiobook of it on YouTube right now.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36307,I can look it up.  Up  Dick I'm german's dicks vapor rub think this is  Crowdicose t r a c t a t u s
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36338,Don't haha me or I will ban you in chat  What do I spend my weapon points on guys I have fucking 14 shit. What do I fully upgrade?  I can literally flow up good any of my weapons right now I
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36348,I  Love this shotgun so much. I feel like I don't need any other weapon to get the game  You can beat the entire game just the shotguns for the most part except for a few  Places where you really need the plasma rifle. Have you beat this game on?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36364,nightmare  Yeah, you better watch out. Okay. No, unfortunately, I've got some work to do so I'm gaming every day all day  Okay. Okay. Let's do the arveless.  Kill $20.  Seven dollars for a paper bag? What the fuck is this?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36391,This is highway robbery.  Jesus. That's college for you.  What? No, it's not. I wish college textbooks were seven dollars for a fucking paper bag.  Holy shit.  I don't know how good your use books are always my one was pretty generous, but
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36409,fair enough.  Well, that my professors did the bullshit where there was like a new  fucking edition like every year and you get the net the updated edition, even  though the older books were basically the same fucking thing.  Oh, they're there.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36421,They're different exercises in California.  Oh, are they?  Their rules. Yeah, so it's pretty great  That kind of Pia  IRL cheat code right here  I'm not going to say that.  Hi.  This video is pressuring me to say hi because I didn't say bye properly.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36446,Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  So, thank you.  So, this one, two, like, Konami codes to use against philosopher types, like, um,  around at least in my experience in social sciences of academia, is you  pull up Ludwig with Wittgenstein, which is basically again a philosopher whose
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36473,entire life was dedicated to calling other philosophers dumb, and  understanding the reason, part of the reason his motivation for doing this is  America's, oh no America Europe's going through World War I World War II, and in  his perspective it demonstrates the failure of most moral philosophy
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36488,analysis because it shows just there's not in his perspective there's not there is nothing  so that's interesting now the more critical counterpoint to a lot of philosophy and you can  pull up a social science argument and go straight into the material conditions or ceiling conditioner
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36505,like that you're just straight into that this call rem a fucking beta and that doesn't say  or you can do the psychological attack to say he's a nerd we try and favor up for the  director. Seems like the most effective strategy unfortunately. Well it's good
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36522,after politics man. Sure you think you think when the two congress will ring  it's each other like well I root my photos off both theories and in hue in my  opponent is it to put her up she wants to look at that that's being one cares
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36541,Oh, nice. Good. Good one. Good one.  has  Lewis  is
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36573,If you go to Wikipedia you can find the entire  Publications a tricus by Lutu  We've been signing some eyes down to seven points and then his thesis if you're feeling really lazy or slash hell yeah  That's my shit. You got a link for them
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36590,Carving out of the ballista. You mean the armless. Oh  Oh my god.  Oh, hell yeah.  Oh wait, that just says bad title.  No, no, no, I don't have time for this.  What?  I do have time to click it.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36617,It just says bad title.  Like it doesn't give me anything.  Let's see, let's oops.  Wait, holy shit, what's all that down there?  I'll get an option to fast travel here, guys, right?  Oh, I got it.  I got it.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36645,Wait, because I, it's not going to let me, if I try to jump down there, oh, it won't  even let me go down there.  there's stuff down there  So basically is the seven D C's of  Ludwig and Pelogation's Tricuses the world's everything that is the case
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36664,What is the case the fact is the existence of atomic facts?  Logical picture of facts is thought through significant performance  Interfunctions are functions of truth and I'll learn her to propositions the jail for a function is the jail for our position
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36678,where of one cannot speak there for one must be silent  I sound like a fucking Mario  said that  well it's it's the one beat philosophy like I really really respect  it's entire it's an entire book  it's an entire philosophical theory on telling their philosophy
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36700,losses go fuck themselves I really respect that  that's practice  Yeah.  Well, I don't know if this one works on rem because, you know, he doesn't have his  degree yet.  So we have to come up.  Oh, true, true, true.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36716,You do need a college degree to get understand these deep fill us off.  We'll take here.  Oh, what an amazing.  Anybody else love this fucking shotgun?  Oh my God.  I am a shotgun slut  Can I is the game gonna get any harder than this or is this a guy's it should I just call Mr. Moon and tell him to fucking
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36742,Turn it in  I had a moon are you at this point did he ever get even close to this far?  Look at that easy look at how easy it is  You want to be an adult and talk to room about his utility of philosophy arguments look up Aristotle's
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36795,and a couple of GE's in college and some reading class.  Wow, sounds like you're not very qualified to say that.  Yeah, here I'll go,  because commits to Bill Coo right now  or insults in the honor of the switch screen.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36812,You might be spreading around dangerous ideas  of philosophy right now, you better watch that?  Yeah, dangerous ideas.  So I would say the most dangerous idea other  than that was this suggestion  you need to have an academic rounding to discuss philosophy.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36833,What?  All right, I'm gonna fuck off. Thanks for the conversation.  There you go. Yeah, have fun, please, how many?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36878,able to determine that yet I understand the link what I'm saying is like because  we didn't start testing till so late are we actually able to even know yeah we  have for most cases.  I mean, one second I'll get you a nice little graphic.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36895,fifth  quarter  of +(  up
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36925,Now let's do this.  Boom  The power up re I don't need power-ups for these  theCynicalWeeb
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,36978,Yeah.  That how long does this last for?  Oh, we're done.  Oh, whoosh.  Shhh  Whoa not where I wanted to go  11  half
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37029,the  whole thing a lot of bullshit as damage here boys  it's not really any other way to describe it  No.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37059,Yes.  Boom.  Boom.  Stop.  No.  Wait.  No.  Okay.  Stop.  Did I get finished?  Did I get finished?  I got about a mile?  Yeah.  I think so.  I need to sleep soon though. Holy shit, it's way too late.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37090,What? What do you want?  The fuck out of here?  There are 12 levels. What level am I on right now?  As soon as I have the hook shot and the frost grenade  And then like the armor and shit.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37109,Oof, this game got significantly easier.  Holy shit.  Wait, am I missing something?  I feel like the last level had decent difficulty spike,  but that was my perspective and opinion.  And sure we'll see.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37154,three ! sprays I'm not not such aOT  Arblest mod master. I need to kill a lot of those guys. Rip and tear as they say.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37193,Go to Marauder yet? Should start your lose 7 lives. I'm ready for Marauders as normal enemies.  Okay. Except I haven't seen one yet.  How far am I from like the first Marauder?  I wanna see one.  End of level? Am I close to the end of this level?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37221,Wha? Okay, dude.  What?  I think you're at the end almost at the end of the level. I remember like another 20 minutes, maybe two thirds to the end. Holy shit.  I think.  This is so fucking long.  It's one of the hardest encounters. Do you ever encounter Maratos as like normal enemies or?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37254,I  Don't remember it's been a bit Mr.. One or you're gonna be asked dudes. I have no idea. I don't know if they are  I'm trying to died in five seconds. Okay  So I sent you a link you want to see a map of cases in the nation
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37277,in the nation. I'm going to put half of our stuff to the DGG.  Yeah, you can ice-class my check.  So for those looking at the map, that's what we're looking at right now  in terms of cases in the states.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37305,And right now the outbreak seems mostly focused around New York.  Now part of that is because it's the most, one of the most dense cities in the country, so thus that's where it's going to be.  But also it's like the so far arts probably made to a city in the country that has the most options for testing people and such that.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37328,So the terrifying answer is if that is proportional to what we are looking at nationally with  maybe some slight adjustments for less density, that's really scary.  The bigger issue ends up being how long this is going to take and do we try to exit out
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37349,of this quarantine?  Yeah.  We should.  Yeah.  I don't think it's realistic that we can shut everything down like this for like two  months that seems or I mean I guess we I think it's insane I mean I mean there
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37364,was an estimate I saw which estimates that the program 10,000 people hospitalized  the some percent of us be only dead for every week that we did warranty and  previously yeah and that predicts forward also so essentially yeah how
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37380,many people would you okay with dying we didn't need to if we left early  And that's what we're getting into.  Further, as more of this disease has turned out, it seems to, yes, it seems to, of course,  an effect ge elderly, but if I look at it, oh, just anyone who has pre-existing vision
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37402,and effect, they're breathing, they are very much affected.  That starts to add to a lot of people being especially vulnerable to this disease.  In an empathetic world, I would say this could maybe last since the summer, but in terms of policy-wise in the world of our world, we might end it in Easter like the President wants.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37426,I don't think we will, I think, this will have minimum go towards Till May.  I think it might go past May, depending on how nasty the case is getting, how high the digital gets.  gets the same way there might there's a lot of bull we're calling for and now
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37442,there weren't people who are calling for the quarantine to maintain if we start  seeing the deaths by expo it might be I don't know can we go back to quarantine  or will it be pretty fucked by then I mean can we go back because yeah the state
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37456,the state the government have the the infrastructure to do that yeah and if we  were to stock going quarantine per week then get back into it that'd be a lot  better than just not keep going and pretending like nothing happened.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37467,But far better.  So I mean, overall, to be responsible on this platform, everyone will wash your hands seriously.  Like if you want to look up how surgeons wash their hands, wash your hands like that.  If you can be inside, be inside.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37485,If you have to work, make sure you file the right paperwork to try to be compensated most  appropriately and be safe.  like, unfortunately, this disease is really nasty and we're at moment in our country's  history where people are going to decide what's more valuable. They're financial economic
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37503,stability of their future or their health stability of the future.  Hey, poor people have to make those decisions all the time already, so.  Yeah, but this is even more extreme now. And further, now the one point of joy is like,
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37517,I was honestly surprised with how robust the current bailout was. I thought it'd be much  more cooler and much more effective  needs for the average person and  it's far more generous than I thought  a Republican presidency and  Republican dominate Senate would never allow
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37532,and the Democrats have suggested  that they're willing to push hard for more  or I mean I think Trump is like  fucking terrified  like the one thing that Trump had going for  that you really couldn't attack on is  economy has been going pretty well
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37546,like even the average working class person  thinks like very highly of our current economy  If that tanks, holy fuck you, Republicans are so the soul of the fucking devil, which is basically what they consider any form of like fucking financial stimulus to be, unless it's for war, in order to like avoid like some catastrophic fucking economic meltdown.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37564,Yeah, what's interesting is, tragedies are opportunities for victory or failure.  So at the moment it seems like where once maybe two months ago we thought where the  Democrat nominee was, they maybe were going into this group for five point lead against
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37582,Trump, maybe, then there were some estimates that maybe that was less than that.  But now if Trump, if this course is maintained, assuming the Democrat, whoever the Democrat  is completely incompetent, like they might go to sweep Trump completely because he's
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37596,going to be the president that let the economy collapse and cause the deaths of thousands,  potentially hundreds of thousands of Americans. However, like the reality is like if we put  if Trump's people got pretty competent, like there are ways you would turn this into a victory
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37613,for Trump for Trump and his people, because this is right. Like the reality is like  like if the Democrats were completely dedicated to peer  apathetic sense to victory above all else, then they would not  allow stimulus to happen.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37627,They would do the McCall strategy, just block, block, block,  and let the people who hold the most  political power to take the blame.  Yeah.  And they could even say it's because they're not happy  with certain provisions or whatever, like AOC,
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37638,you know, about businesses and shit.  Although I don't.  I think that is such a gambit.  Oh my god.  Well, unfortunately, regardless of the political theory  It seems mr. Colosse should demonstrate in the past that that's a fairly successful path victory like to really speak
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37652,Well, but I feel like blocking supreme most I would venture a guess that 90% of Americans don't understand like cloture  Cloud sure I don't know you pronounce it. Yeah closure or like how the  Majority rules in the Senate or the block are the filibuster any of that work
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37666,So like I think like blocking Garland that's like something you can get away with it's very hard to like say like well  They didn't let him hear a Supreme Court nominee like that's a really most Americans don't understand the process
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37676,But like blocking the fucking lifeblood for like American workers and shit. I feel like that would be a way harder one to get away with  what should we understand the  performance block everything back in the day like  everything short of like tax cuts basically they blocked when they held power
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37693,Yeah, sure, but like a lot of stuff they blocked  So like that's why Obama famously did a lot of executive orders sure and it's in it seems that the current political theory of America  is based on the McConnell theory of political change.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37706,If you block blocks, if you hold one  of the power in federal government,  and you just block everything till it's your election time,  you say, look, these guys just can't get anything done.  You should let voters in the power
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37717,will get things done.  And you could certainly see how the kind of  laymen-plook with respect to what would work.  Yeah, I totally understand that in normal times,  but this is such an exceptional thing.  This is the whole quarantine and the virus and everything
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37731,I think that there's like way too much national focus on the processes right now  What is this debate shit? Where the fuck is my love mr. Move? I will fucking climb on wait wait wait one second  I'm still in my city in shed my corona infected skin flakes down like they were
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37748,Zombie ant fungus pores if you don't get his chunky ass on panoko  Jesus. Ah, just tell me when. Okay, yeah, go for it. Okay, sorry.  Well, again, if you, I think if you were willing to be complete political monsters,
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37764,Napa, the suffering of millions of people, I think you could turn this to Democrats,  put charges in place, political, the West, and look Trump had all this power. He's got  this opportunity. And there's power of the presidency has. Yeah, yeah, no, no, like,
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37776,I totally understand in a book, but I'm buying that I understand that. I'm just saying that  this particular thing like there's going to be so much pressure on this one  piece of legislation somebody eyes to it  that i don't know if you can get by because i think that largely the
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37789,success of of uh... blocking stuff has been through obfuscation because a lot  of the parents  america's just don't understand the political process  but everybody understands like  this stimulus bill needs to happen everybody's debating it and if somebody  blocks it
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37801,people are gonna know  in a way more like material sense than like  whose blocking supreme court was that's that's just my feeling on it  I think the observation was work. I think you could play it properly. I think you could
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37814,play it properly. You could pitch it as like, oh, they're probably going to don't care about  you. They don't want to vote on it. And of course some of them will say, no, we do want  to vote on it. And you could work, make that work. I think the observation was, I think
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37826,you could place the verm plan around. This is purely, let's both arc and political theory  on this. However, the counter argument further needs to be if you're, if you're, if you're  completely back bench coaching it sort of thing.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37841,They need to recognize that in theory if Trump plays the  cards right, he could turn this into a victor being like,  hey, I'm the guy that sent everyone a bunch of checks.  Where did that end for you?  And that's the reality they're playing with right now.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37855,Now, I don't know if that's gonna work,  but on the other hand, like, if you told me Trump is  president in 2020, I'd be like, oh, well, that's how he did it.  He basically ran on I was the president sent you checks during this this great depression
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37870,recession or whatever.  You should be here again.  I'll send you more checks.  He becomes Mr. UBI or whatever or something like that.  And that could certainly be a pathway to victory again.  And they could he gloss right over all this stuff.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37883,Again.  Yeah.  But overall, like this is far more generous than I honestly thought it would be.  that the Republicans would be more apathetic.  And I think tragically it's almost purely in perspective that a lot of Republican leadership  was in contact or is infected with COVID-19.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37902,I don't think that's a motivation to get stimulus,  but it's not like they need the stimulus.  I really do think it is a political optics thing.  Like there's way too much at stake to risk being the one holding the football on this.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37912,If people start like, Jesus, did you see the unemployment claims?  Oh yeah, oh yeah.  Yeah, like it's so much economic damage.  economic damage there's no way that you can risk fucking that up I think in my  opinion at least I have I have I when I've been whenever I've examined history or
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37932,like my own experience when working examining the tactics of the Republican  Party it seems that whenever they have the option to do the most morally  bankrupt thing for their own personal gain they do it and that makes and there's
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37948,the political theory to that and it's politically consistent with their ideology. I really  do think unfortunately a lot of politics is personal. It's really personal.  I mean like even Bush has done stimulus checks in the past right? Like this is very this
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37963,is very different like Bush when the Bush had an opportunity to swing this one the recession  was breaking out because remember it started under him.  Barely but yeah sure. Well he had the option to try to cut it off early on and it was
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37975,very selective it was very like Bush Bush's people were talking about maybe in theory  letting the banks fail or maybe just being at the banks or something like that.  Like something that needs to remember is like the Obama administration for all its failures
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37989,and successes like it did put some money into people's hands during the bailouts some Bush  were people were talking about putting none of it in people's hands.  Oh it did Bush sign tar but it Obama signed tar but I don't remember.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,37999,Oh man I don't there were so many bills at that time I heard I don't remember I'd have  instead of the recession as well as I showed up. My focus in terms of economic  American history is more around...
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,38008,Bush-Santerical...  Carter and Shock Doctrine, like they  org  and it's far more generous than I thought  their Falcons will allow it to be.  And further the Democrats have said with some teeth behind them that they will push for more which
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,38036,And they seem to be talking about even Nancy Pelosi and Schumer talking about that  It's not just like AOC and Bernie Sanders and on top of that like  Everyone in the Democratic Party is like applauding Bernie for like taking it to the toe with with Republicans on the bailout on his little amendment
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,38053,like  Like this seems to be a moment of change in the general party  almost partially because like  This is such a traumatic moment in American human history that it's kind of make you heal realize what this means sure maybe
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,38069,Yeah, I  Do wonder what how this is going to find the election and unfortunately I do wonder how much of that's going to be in  just examine with the total death the  I'm gonna die.  How did he disappear from my view?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,38086,That was so stupid.  I'm gonna die.  I'm gonna die.  How did he disappear from my view?  That was so stupid.  I'm gonna die.  I think he jumped with some dumb shit.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,38137,How much farther guys I have to sleep holy shit or at least log off and do work.  The random person who's asking if they have COVID-19 you should consult your doctor but  unless you're in. But if you can, stay home and be safe.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,38173,And again, like it's going to vary by state. I think some states are going to try  foolishly to, to quote, open up early. But California and New York have indicated  that minimum they'll be pushing it. They'll be running this till May, which
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,38186,Probably for the safety of the most amount of people, that's for the best.  So, yeah.  May probably may sound that right from all of those,  possibly, and I think likely it's going to go longer.  the  uh...
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,38217,the person asking about mexico  i i honestly don't know the same  the next president yet didn't say that like he's not going to do fuck all about  it is a good fuck or something  Yeah, it's I honestly don't know.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,38233,There's been some interesting analysis  on how it's affecting Africa,  or sub-Saharan Africa specifically.  And basically, because in four countries,  it's harder to be old and like that.  There's fewer older people,  there's fewer people with certain preconditions  that Americans have the luxury to have.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,38254,And survive, yeah.  And survive, but it might have a lower depth tilt,  there further there are some rural areas that will be less effective just  because distance natural distancing does help. I was listening to a  lecture by an epidemiologist who focuses Africa and basically their
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,38274,commentary was like well there are actually some worse diseases affecting  Africa right now and we should examine the world health as a whole isn't  that we are vastly overfunding not just for COVID-19 but for new  infectious diseases but yeah like this is really this is a historical moment
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,38294,for the world and unfortunately it looks like not a lot of places are doing great  with it  wait I missed  Yeah, you guys thought I was going to go without doing a Slayer gate?  Were you think Fan 2016 of doing 2016?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,38327,Hell yeah, I thought it was really well done.  I think I liked this one more though.  This is a really well done game too.  I think I liked 2016 more.  I think it mostly comes down to just like my personal choice of using it of how to use the chainsaw
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,38342,Yeah, like I think it's just a personal style like I feel weird like I  Used to me was just cuz I it's just how I'd be doing  Finally a lot  this current one doesn't really let you do that as much.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,38356,Oh, sure.  No, I'm in team.  So the map I linked, the person that asked about it, so they'll note that the counties are  are drawn up on for capital basis and the dot does represent the number of absolute confirmed cases
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,38382,cases so  No, Harlem has had cases. It's just the dot is  represents the cases of the  individual districts where the color represents the per capita district infection rate  This is why geography is important  the  okay guys  and i get to hear before this was fired or might be a little bit fucked in the
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,38407,beginning  there's always that for the  yeah  it's nice to start for help  you are to add it yet  I'm taking Twitch people and I guess viewers on Twitch with the quarantine.  It's hard to say.  When I'm doing politics and stuff, yeah, I do really well.

XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,38486,Oh hello. Is this the boss guys? Are we doing it? Oh wait not yet.  For the person who asks yes, Trump's in action on COVID-19 has probably resulted in  a significant increase in death that turns to have to have to have to have to

XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,38660,move that's now found in a lot of American media.  Okay, this was a mistake on this.  Let's play a little slower.  This is my stream.  If you have a question for me, you can tweet at me or message me at
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,38688,at my Twitter at Doug of CA. If you want more exact questions, not during the  boss fight you can ask for the Destiny and I guess he could forward them on to  me if he thinks they're interesting with discussing if he's not about the
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,38703,sleeve. Rough through the boss fight. Definitely stepping after the boss fight.  Alright, turn the volume back up, wish me luck.  Did you frag grenades now I guess?

XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,38774,How many lives did Mr. Booten have when he got to this boss?  Was it three or two?  Oh, zero.  Oh, damn.  That's a savage.  Let's see if we could have beaten it under Mr. Mutins.  Zero life.  All are personnel.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,38790,The Mutul challenge to have entered the compound.  Evacuation is advised.  What are you doing this time?  Fuck.

XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,39033,I have so many points, I just don't know what to do with it.  The Arbolist charge up is here.  Have you upgraded the miniga?  It's really good for killing bosses.  No, but I'm too scared to try to learn a new gun right in the middle of a fight.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,39044,I'm not going to.  I can't think of that.  Have you the rocket, the lock on the rocket?  It's what I'm going to do.  It's located at the top of this facility.  Attention.  Emergency protocols have been activated.  Please exit the facility now.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,39059,Don't use the rocket launcher.  Wait, why?  I'm not sure.  Dr. Hayden was convinced to come here for this eventually.  Can I just say that it is an honor for me personally to meet you?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,39090,I...  Attention! Emergency protocols have been activated. Please exit the facility now.  if  if  ‑‑ this is kind of cheating if you just appear in here
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,39162,I have been open.  Let me help you to see Slayer.  Marauder is a defensive powerhouse.  Stand too close to use his shotgun.  Stand too far away.  Those projectiles came up mid-range.  The counter attacks on his eyes flash green, otherwise he blocks your shots.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,39187,Marauder is resistant to super weapons.  I'm gonna go.  What a super weapons man.  I'll get him in again.  Please.  I'm not sure if I can shoot him with my rocket launcher and shit.  I don't even know what the fuck that was.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,39231,Next  We'll see you soon...  What are we going scorching...  Do we need you...  Alright  You are hurt  I'm not gonna die.  Can I kill the dog?

XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,39358,80  five  Fuck, I really want health or armor.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,39406,It just maxed out  I  Created it once or twice I think but or I just got my second I think  He just chainsaw people for him. Oh fucking okay. I have gotten everything  Okay  I shouldn't have died at all for this game.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,39433,I'm upset that the dog shit fucked my head up.  Okay.  So that was a common discussion.  I guess I made some that all in a night.  Yeah, for sure. I got a sleep. Yeah, maybe next time. Oh, wait. Sorry. Hold on. Fuck. It's really
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,39461,low. All right. Wait. Sorry. What are we saying? It's been fun. I always enjoy this  discussions. If you want to talk about COVID-19 in the future for just some overall, like,  my perspective and academic research and analysis would recommend on how to
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,39483,like the various political action characters are handling the COVID-19  crisis. You can talk about that in the future. It's really fun. I'm cluttered by the  compliments you're chatt-gaping. Always a pleasure to talk to you. Good night  I'm just going to do this a little bit of story on the wall.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,39513,I'm calling it.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,39543,And he's transferring himself into your ship's pain frame.  The architecture is similar to his own.  This wall.  The final priest is hiding in Sentinel Prime.  The Khan may do not want him to be easily found.  The only functional slip gate to Sentinel Prime is in the core of Mars.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,39571,In the lost city of the Beth.  I have marked its location for you, but getting there will take time.  There is no easy way to access the core of Mars.  There are no known pathways that lead there, Dr. Hayden.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,39590,The BFG-10000, designed by Dr. Samuel Hayden, as part of the anti-domonic defense grid.  I understand searching the coordinates to the BFG-10,000 now.  You can't just shoot a hole into the surface of Mars.  The portal is ready.  Wait, is there anything I can do here? I've got five keys.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,39624,Yeah, but keep telling me to shoot a red thing in this room. Is that like not until the very end or something?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,39654,Should I just fully upgrade my miniga? I don't even know. Fuck did I have so many weapon points that I don't have to do with them all?  I think that if I was speedrunning this game  I don't tell bootness
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,39663,But I don't think you should do the Slayer gates because who the fuck needs all these weapon upgrades  I thought that I'd be doing them to like unlock like cool shit  And it would be like helping me in my run, but I don't think so. I think it's just
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,39671,vote  on a bench as of all maybe maybe actually looking what
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,39717,Ooh.  If
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,39811,Okay, that's just cosmetic bullshit.  I don't have grades which I don't really give a fuck about.  Prater points, these are what I really like.  Yeah, what I've got needs to.  Don't have that shit.  Don't give a fuck.  That's like a level up shit.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,39835,That's good, but we already have them both.  I'm going to get that one.  Prader point?  Nope, I've already got that one.  Fuck!  There are two more points on the ship.  I think there might only be one more.  I know there's this guy here.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,39857,Are there any more on the ship somewhere that I've missed?  Oh, I guess I can just check my mini-man.  I meant those two. This is the last one. Okay. Yeah, I'm fine. So the rest of my shit is just weapon upgrades then, huh?
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,39876,I guess we start upgrading Fag frag grenades.  Scatter bomb seems pretty good I guess.  larger auto map reveal reveals position of all progression items this means the  extra lives to right
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,39906,that's  all the keys for  the one shitty weapon  wait do i really  It's shitty?  You better not be shitty, what do you mean?  Wait, I only have 4 or 6.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,39938,It's worse than the beauty.  Wait, does the weapon actually sucks?  Okay.  I want to exit to main menu. I sure want to quit your latest progress will be saved. Okay  Okay, I think this is the earn I think the way we'll try to do this is I'll give mr
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,39966,Mooten like one run because he told me to finish this run and I think really could but maybe we'll let him try to do  One run and if he finishes that run then we'll call it a draw  But if he doesn't then he just lose it assuming I win this round we'll see
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,39991,It lasted longer there five seconds alright could like  I'm gonna come and donate it instead if you clutch  Okay, so hopefully tomorrow is our last day with them  I love you guys. It's been fun rip Reno cappuccino  I know Pachino Hapachino, Mappachino, Dabachino, Gabachino, Abachino, Abachino, Abachino, I do it right now.
XSiDSRLxe58,20200328,40022,So could you guys next stream or a Reno?  Oh, most waffles.  I just grabbed the  wrench within these  purpose that doubled the  Victor Smith  and did.
