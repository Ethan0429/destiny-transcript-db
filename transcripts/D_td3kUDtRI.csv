D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,0,... What's up?.. My internet has been going in and out and in and out. I don't know why. I will say though that it's an Omega Yikes fam. An Omega Yikes.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. wall, we're all within certain lanes. There was the socialist lane with Bernie, Yang,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,745,and then Elizabeth Warren. And then you basically had everybody else on the moderate lane. And then when basically what you had was all of the moderates drop out and endorse Joe Biden, which basically just goes to show you that all of the people that supported all of those moderate
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,761,candidates, they all went to Joe Biden, not because they think Joe Biden's super electable, or they think Joe Biden can be Trump. No, they did. They went to Joe Biden, nice, they disagree with socialism. I still refuse to believe that that policy has nothing to do
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,777,with any of these votes and that socialism is super popular. It gets destroyed in every election. It's tried. Yeah, but that does this notion that they didn't vote for him. Social is electability. First of all, I, I, I guess I agree with, I agree with leisure fan that
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,790,that socialism, you know, when actually presented to people is less popular than people are trying to frame it to be. So I guess I agree with them on that. But like, there's notion that Andrew Yang is a socialist in what can you tell me why as a socialist? Because if it's a thousand dollars a
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,804,month, President Trump is talking about doing that right now. He's not that's so preposterous. That's not the same for whatsoever. And it's not just socialism for an emergency period. No, no, I mean, this is basically, that's quite the same. This is not a tax cut. This is
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,825,a check you're getting your perspective. Well, it depends on the, yeah, it's a rebate check. You know, are they call it a rebate? Because it's coming back from what you paid in your taxes. So if somebody paid $10,000 in taxes and they get $1,000 check back, that's a that's not how,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,838,by the way, that's not how refundable tax credits work. I know he said a rebate, but if we're talking about a refundable tax credit or fundable tax credit can actually give you negative income, you can get money back from from even if you didn't pay that income tax in.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,850,So that's actually not true. You can get more back in taxes than you ever paid in with refundable tax credits. Just FYI, like general. No, I don't think it I don't think it is. And I think this over how does the
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,861,four ones are so I don't think anyway, because it's the government, the meaning it's like saying if the government does something that socialism is the military that is literally right. Social is my social. That's my point. I don't think so. No, I think the social
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,875,is the control over the means of production by the government and the distribution of funds is not a control over the means of production by the government. Doing it could be a mixed capitalist stimulus is socialism. That's my point. Yeah. Okay. Is that what it is not social? Sure. Sure.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,891,So so doing it's not just getting it's by the way tax credits that are refundable are money that you get back that you never paid is not just getting tax money back. That's just not true. True. Wait, so so as somebody who's actually who actually knows the policy
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,904,positions of the democratic candidates, unlike lecture fan, like his characterization of what is like the lanes, it's just so wrong. I mean, most people don't know this because they're actually too caught up in their echo chambers, but my internet no.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,925,Great. I agree. Pete was I mean, frankly, is the sounds internet are fucking up to is this a California thing or what is it the very first democratic debate streaming those moderators? There's no does not be that it says streaming till it breaks. Oh, okay. Good. Fuck.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,944,That's do you guys want to raise taxes on the working poor Americans to pay for free healthcare for illegal aliens and every single one of them raise their hands? And so that's why I was saying earlier Bernie Sanders has been incredibly successful in moving the democrat
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,956,part way outside the industry. I'm sorry. Human beings are human beings. So I'm sorry. You got to be on that beyond that. Even if you don't think they're human beings, they are still, I think they're human beings. I think it's hard to make this point without acknowledging that,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,972,but even if you don't think they should get health care, the fact is they are still human beings who can serve as disease vectors as we're learning right now. And therefore, even by self interest alone, you should have a reason you want them to get a health care.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,982,Yep. True. So apart from being a good person's and absolutely practical reality, if they don't get health care, we all suffer. Yeah. Okay. So you're so you're so you are defending raising taxes on working Americans to give out. Yeah. By the way, why are you mentioning good working Americans?
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1000,What kind of social is nonsense is that all Americans being attacked and some other and to say working Americans is just Sanders says it's not no, but no, it's not. It is nonsense. So you know, every American pays taxes. We all pay sales.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1016,That's to say that to say that. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. He's right. Every American does pay taxes in one form another. If you pay rent, then you're helping to pay the property tax that your landlord has. If you buy goods or
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1032,services, you're paying sales tax. I mean, like in one form, another you're generally paying some sort of tax. Dude, if I have to be in quarantine, oh my god. With no internet. And without Molina here, holy shit. Are you getting DDoS? No, and it's not just I'm not just saying that because I don't want to
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1067,say it from any guy. I legit think the internet is just having a lot of problems right now. It's being like really weird. It was storming earlier. I say storming. It was raining. I don't know if it ever storms in California. So I don't. I don't know if like some shit is going on right
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1084,now or our shouldn't say storms are helping. I don't know if it ever storms in LA. Yeah. Did the TV as I got drop out? Yeah, he wanted to postpone for whatever reason. All right, who lives in LA? Never mind. We're fine.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1130,This combo is going to spicy. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, nothing. It's worth nothing. It's worthless. She's the people on the right. Don't understand. That's great. You got not
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1143,contributed because you were just coming in that you should not have general access to any kind of like social benefits. This is dumb, dude. Even at least people are like, wow, you're saying even the most conservative of immigration authors agrees that all forms of immigration
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1164,and you'll be economic benefits, even if they represent some sort of fiscal drain. Yes, this even includes illegals. I can't. Why? Because you're an actual citizen of the country. So what? What? What does that mean? What? Because you need because you are in your country and
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1189,you're sitting on your hands. You don't have to. You don't have to. You don't have to. You don't have to. Answer your own question. Come on. You, you, you, you, you were once again focusing on your own question. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Let me answer your question. Okay.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1204,It's because you cannot go into Mexico and get that kind of care. Why? You can't go to other countries and just get that kind of care. So if you're an American and you are here because why? You don't want to matter. You don't want anyone from any because you because we pay into our system
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1219,to take care of our citizens. What is there? I pay into the system. First of all, because government taxes me. Second of all, because I want care. Not because I have some misguided notion. I'm going to help my fellow man.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1233,All right. That is secondary and to help my fellow citizens. All right. So that's that is absolutely arbitrary to say that I want to help my fellow citizens, but I don't want to help my fellow human beings. Like who is actually who you take responsibility for taking care of.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1247,This is a really hard argument from Bassett. The form of immigration, you'll be economic benefits like I was saying, even if it represents some sort of fiscal trade, it's a long time scale. If you offer free health care,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1260,generation, the physical drain is gone. Listen to the thing that would create a new incentive for people to seek a house of order just to get health care like if they really needed it, you know, in a desperate situation. Look, that incentive is already there. They can already go into
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1273,hospital anytime and then just not, I guess theoretically avoid bill. But free health care. If you're not paying for it at point of purchase and you're not going to get emergency care, it's free, I guess. Yeah, you're already there. Yeah. And if it's already there and we
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1287,you're talking about more. No, like it's probably hard to sneak across the border. By the way, but if you need the expensive long term, I just sent you a message on board if you can check it. And you get for free by sneaking across the border. I have to think that would
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1301,change the balance of people who illegally immigrate. You can just make it so that the types of health care outside of emergency services are unavailable to non-citizens or recent immigrants. This is really easy to do. People understand that. It's so easy to do that. Wait, so you would
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1316,data from other countries that are like more open towards immigrants getting care at a point of entry over a long period of time we can look at. All of the studies that anyone has ever seen shows that immigrants just don't do this weasily as shit that you guys think that they're doing.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1329,You know, just walk into a country book and get health care and just fuck off for the rest of the 16 hours a day for three years. Nobody said that. Nobody said that. Let's actually have a conversation about whether or not immigrants are a fiscal benefit to society which every single
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1344,study shows legal immigrants are massively profitable to whatever country they do. Yeah, but this whole discussion is about whether or not illegal immigrants have access to health care. Yeah, but this is why included illegal. No, he said illegal and illegal. Oh, okay. No, all of the
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1362,all of this that there's multiple studies that show illegal aliens are a fiscal net fiscal drain. No, he's right there and net fiscal drain, but they are an economic boon. It's very hard to trace the final fiscal impact once you account for all of the economic activity generated by
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1383,said illegal immigrants. Cato was done like 1000 fucking studies on this exact topic. And I will in turn post it in the regular chat and you guys can also post it in your chats as well. So go ahead and write into the court where it says text chat. Go ahead post in there and I'll go ahead
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1400,and take it from there. And then you guys can take it from your from the text chat and post in your chat as well. Go ahead. I'm sorry. Go ahead. What what I would love is for I guess Democrats think
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1410,this makes sense like to really to run on the idea of raising taxes on Americans making over 29,000 while we're in doesn't like your fans right that's a really hard time 35 grand crank up their taxes so you can give free health care to illegal aliens. If you actually think that's going to be like
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1426,a politically smart move, good luck. All right, look, you're right, you're right, you're a difficult argument to make when you've got people talking about common sense and seven empirical reality. But the fact is thousands or hundreds at least studies have been done on this.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1440,I don't know if there have been hundreds of studies. That's a lot of that's a lot of studies. Probably. Sorry. What's the job? I've been in. You can offer. Wait, wait, wait, and I've already done I've already pointed out the fact that even if you say they're a drain in the
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1453,first generation, which is not always true. But even if it is by the time they get to the second generation, both generations include their net positive. But we're talking about the can you offer free health care to illegal immigrants and not do in practice because we give them access
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1466,to our emergency room. Let me answer. No, no, no, you can't answer because he can ask the question. See these guys are all so mad. You can't get if you're at illegal. Let me answer. Let me answer a question. Can we let them answer the question? We show this mythical illegal alien who's going to
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1487,take all the way across the border to get non essential medical services in the US and the no essential medical services to. Yeah, I mean, I can't join every unfair. It's not going to like gang up like that. I don't think that's already provided. Sure. Yeah.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1505,Steven, I should not. He turns himself into a pickle. Funny as shit I've ever seen. Phone is mean. Imagine an ironically posting you have a laugh. There are millions of studies that show that being below master tier and playing league on
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1539,a long run. Stream severely lowers viewership. True. They're a net boom in some ways more than Americans are than citizens are not talking about immigrants. What would be the same across the board? What do you mean? You're talking about? Do you think they're very individual status?
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1560,Do you think that changes things? Yeah, it's a substantial change. We actually vet people coming in legally that they are going to have to do with their taxation with their use of government services. We have our immigration. Are immigration. They're committing crimes by the way.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1581,Which makes them less of a drain on the system than American citizens. Of course, they're magical citizens. We accept that. Are you kidding me? Is this the answer? Oh my god. What's happening? They have a one. You're literally.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1618,Wait, is my stream bugging? Is this happening? What is that even 100% crime? They're all illegal. That's all you got. Do you think the US citizens are like at a 90% crime rate? Like how many citizens have ever sped before? Or yet again, this is the same.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1641,I just told me that wait is it. I'm counting against fucking Mexico. And now you're going around and around and around. One hundred percent. They all commit crimes 100% they are here illegally. You can't say oh except that crime. You do live here.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1670,Time and every single time. It's a crime. Just a magic. They're coming here to provide economic value. I'm not with the victim or not. I'm with my tax money. Getting this guy actually pays back. No, I'm not. No, I'm not. No, I'm not. No, I'm not. No, I'm not. No, I'm not. No, I'm not.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1688,It shows that the economy benefits from them being inside of it. I don't care. We're talking about a crime rate. We're talking about a crime rate. No, no, no. He just said illegal is called meant a lower crime rate than American. Yes, they do.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1701,They want your brain dead and think that's it actually matters that they are illegal. Except for when they committed legal crimes that well when they're not illegal crimes just immigrating after they've immigrated they commit much less crime than natives. That is just a
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1719,thing. If they committed to felony of illegal immigration then they stop committing crimes. So we just ignore that one. I commit. We're not. We ignore one crime. We ignore one crime. Yes, it was ridiculous victimless crime. It's like saying that we should we should talk about it.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1736,We should have been a crime and they commit less crimes. No, they all commit crimes. Actually, that's a ridiculous crime though. Oh, no, it's a crime. It doesn't matter. They commit a 100% crime rate. If you want to focus on law as the founder of justice but the fact is justice exists
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1750,irrespective law and the fact that it's illegal doesn't make it wrong and the fact that it that they are here illegally doesn't mean that they commit more crime once they are here than native born Americans. Bossa, is there any country in the world?
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1762,Is there any country in the world? Is there any country in the world where you can immigrate in and you cannot be a native citizen and you can live there or any country in the world that naturalizes anyone who comes into their borders and has full access to all social
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1777,like programs no matter what. No, is there any country in the world? There should be because the United States. You know either the United States or the United States. You're going to talk about the United States being a being a being like other countries.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1788,Let's talk about the way this country was founded. When this country was founded, there were no demanders in the world. There were no free constitutional republics in the world. We were the first despite the advice of all the rest of the world to not be that way.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1798,We became the greatest country in the world by leading the way. Despite the advice of the rest of the way. Let me trade as we should lead the way. I mean, you're literally, let me ask all the left is a question.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1807,Why don't you think any countries are legal? Because other countries are wrong. That's why. They're wrong. You make the wrong. We should leave the world in the sense. Okay, here let me ask you guys to talk about a crime on the level of speeding right now.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1819,Let me ask you guys a call of pressure. If the civilians are so wonderful and they commit no crimes and they're great for the economy, then why don't you want those people to stay in their own country where they can stay there?
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1834,Because labor is unproductive unless it is introduced to capital that can utilize its utilize it as an economic resource. Mexico does not have the productive capital in place to utilize that labor. Hence, they move north to work in the United States.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1857,But I know you don't understand capitalism, but the world, the global economy gains from the free movement of labor. Yeah, just to be clear, I would expect that a conservative understands capitalism. But I guess I'm, I don't know, he is being a condescending prick isn't a very good
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1872,much to come to the United States and they have access to the capital that allows them to be as productive as they can be, even doing some of the same work. They become more productive by a factor of 10. So the whole world benefits anyway in the sense that when one boat runs all right.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1885,Do you think she really should cheat on it? She doesn't want to because it would be unfair to get up on him, which I agree is actually gets destroyed at the actual elections in the United States. Bernie Sanders, we can see the numbers argument that I'm going to get destroyed.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1899,No, which drop that I'm going to laugh all the way. Wait, wait, wait, I'm sorry, lecture fan, just to burst your bubble. Have you got democratic numbers for how many people are coming out? Entruder. You should be a massive blue wave. Come again.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1916,Who knows? This is why the truth. Are you? What are you? What are you? Great. Turnouts. Republicans are at science because science. Oh my God. Have increased turnout. Disproportion. Like what do you mean? Like compared to Hillary Clinton. Oh, wow.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1931,Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That Hillary Clinton. Oh, wow. Crush Trump by three million votes, by the way, just heads up on that one. Careful. Shit. You're done. I'm going to fucking love it when we go to the polls and we're running that
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1946,bitch down. Dude, you guys thought Bernie Sanders was going to win. Your prediction suck. No. What do you mean my prediction? Yeah. I never thought Bernie Sanders was going to win. You guys all thought Bernie Sanders was going to win.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1957,Like some of the worst people in the world about this year. I never stated that Bernie Sanders had it by a fucking mild. None of us here. I like this straw man shit. None of us here. I thought Bernie was going to.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1967,Oh, no, never mind. I thought he was saying it by Hillary versus Trump. Because you can clearly see it is that people are coming out in tros to vote for new Democratic candidates. It happens to be Biden. We're getting behind him.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1977,Malarik in 2020. Let's go. I'm uncomfortable by the amount of seeming an ironic Biden tramps now or Biden stand. We're all excited for Biden. Oh my. Hell yeah, dude. Malarik in 2020. You're excited for Trump, dude. You see the guy on the phone.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,1993,Good man. All right. Yay. We come to the end of this free form round. Now we're going to do the closing arguments. And I think we're going to start off with last year today. Remember the rules. You are to give your closing arguments under two minutes or two minutes and under.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2014,And you are not to interrupt anyone. And please show respect and let people make their closing arguments before we get to the really fun part. Okay. Last year's the name. Please take it away. There was like 10 different conversations happening at the same time there.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2029,I pretty much said my thing about Bernie at the start. I guess I'll just wrap up with my position on the whole immigration thing. No. Rob, grab me a bit. So I'm a libertarian. I believe in open borders. I think people should be free to move.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2046,Wow. An actual libertarian. Interesting. Okay. And I would probably support that even as long as we have a welfare state. But I suspect that probably you would have a problem if you had both of those policies that people could move freely across the border.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2059,And they would get lots of free government services. I think that would create an incentive that would destroy those welfare programs. Now I'm in favor of getting rid of the welfare programs and allowing the free movement. I think that's a much better alternative.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2074,But I'm pretty sure that you're going to have a problem trying to have both. So that's just could be true. That's a fair take. Yeah. You would have to do something to limit the utilization of the free services.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2084,Sure. All right. I mean, I don't know. I really enjoyed some of the topics that we had about earlier and this one in particular. Because I really liked getting into the numbers about the polls as well as the Democratic voter-based
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2101,turnout numbers because it seems like for some reason Republicans here haven't looked at the Democratic turnout numbers. So I highly recommend you look into the primary turnout numbers. It's not looking too good for you, Lance. Why be so careful?
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2114,Doggy shit. It's really hard to say who's going to win. Oh, no. The only reason why Republicans still have faith in Donald Trump is because they constantly refuse time and time again to recognize science numbers. I mean, statistics, psychologists.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2128,I mean, all the entire scientific communities coming together and showing you why it doesn't make sense to support Trump in any kind of way. But you still do it. I mean, that's fine. That's what you want to do.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2139,That's what you're going to do. I mean, we're going to see. I mean, that's all I can say in Milwaukee 2020. All right. Bosti it. Yeah. So yeah, I agree. Milwaukee 2020. I think we already covered the Bernie issue pretty thoroughly.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2154,It would have been good if he had worked on building coalitions, trying to peel a little more to older people who vote more than younger people and try to take a little more of an FDR approach than a revolutionary approach.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2164,I think that stuff works. I mean, I know that I often raise the flag a lot and it may seem like a meme to people, but this stuff really does work. I mean, people really do feel it. So I think it's, and of course, a third party run would have been doing from the start.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2179,That said, I know that we got on immigration somehow. And I think it is absolutely worth remembering that immigration absolutely benefits the United States, including illegal immigration. And when the government tries to stop illegal immigration, all it is doing is stopping Americans
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2196,from realizing their God getting right to the highest standard of living possible. That's all it does. It's otherwise an absolutely victimless crime. And I think that Americans should move. Dude, if Texas goes blue, Holy fuck Republicans. In terms of political feasibility, I've no doubt Americans should push
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2212,toward a society where we have free movement of people and where we recognize that as a fundamental human right, instead of trying to curtail it in some kind of protectionist fashion for the sake of protecting native industries based on long disproven economic theories that
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2228,protectionism is the way to go. It's labor protectionism. The same way that we've surpassed trade protectionism. We should surpass labor protectionism and let labor flow to where capital is available to make it as efficient as possible. That should be the American way.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2242,And that's the way I feel about immigration. All right. How is he? Wait, why isn't this taking up the fertilizer? Well, Larky 2020, give me that looming. It's an immigration. So it doesn't matter. But I'm looking forward to the next round of what is.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2261,Me too, actually. All right. And lecture fan. Yeah, I just think this whole debate has showed once again how disconnected from reality left this Twitch streamers are because Donald Trump won. Wait, why is this not picking it up?
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2274,Largely on his immigration policy ideas. American people want reasonable immigration controls. We want our immigration passed. You just had the the nut job open borders candidate Bernie Sanders get his butt handed to him in the Democrat primary. And this idea that open borders and taxing taxing the working poor in America to give out.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2298,Is it have anywhere to go up to the load? Aliens is electoral suicide. What goes under this bridge? Does this need to be finished? On here are still calling Trump racist, which is another reason he won in 2016 is because
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2308,the American people are sick of the political correctness. And then I mean, if you actually think that Joe Biden is going to be this great, exciting candidate that's going to drive out huge turnout, then I don't. I mean, if anybody is watching this, this is not representative of reality in America.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2330,This is not representative of reality whatsoever. What's what's gone on here? The points of you here are so far outside the American mainstream. It's just not even funny. All right. And Brento. To start with just to reiterate on Bernie, I just don't like I feel like his campaign
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2350,now was the situation of the 2016 campaign. And I just don't feel like people really resonated with his revolution, blame, billionaires, kind of like rhetoric. And we came down to immigration, but it really comes down to the lecture fans right, that
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2368,Trump's take on immigration and anti-legal immigration was one of the most divisive, but also like decisive victories for him, and it's like on policies. And it's because as much as people might support Medicare for all or free community college,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2384,and like a social safety net and social security for retirement, and every kind of like social safety net that we could put in, and especially when it comes to Bernie or Liz before, and talking about free college, safety net, free Medicare, and all every kind of policy.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2399,And then you're just like, well, who's this applied to? We all pay into it. We all pay more taxes. And it's like anyone who walks across the border, they all get it. And everyone innately kind of just goes like, that sounds unsustainable.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2409,That doesn't sound like if we just keep offering and giving free things and increasing taxes, and anyone who comes in has full access to them, whether they work or not, then that just sounds like you're getting screwed. No other country in the entire world is offering that, right?
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2425,And no other country is offering that because that seems like a failed idea. That seems like an idea that won't last. And then to kind of be met with like, calls of like racism or things like that, when people
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2438,bring it up and they bring up those concerns, just kind of cements it. And it's like, well, then it's a topic we can't discuss. And then I think that's a big part of the schism in the country. All right.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2446,So there we go. Okay, we got the voting going on right now. And oh boy, it's really close. We got the conservatives in the lead this time. So vote for one for the liberals, two for the libertarians, and three for the conservatives.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2461,And here we go. We're going to be closing it in 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. And the conservatives won. So that was pretty good. What the conservatives want to around. The liberals won one round.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2500,So there we have it. The conservatives have won the debate for this session. So libertarians coalesce with the conservatives, dude. Every six days they always do. As they always do. I think they always do. I think they always do.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2513,You know what you're right. Last username, you know, saying you should get time six. We should basically have some delegate votes for you. All right, guys. So now we I'm sorry. I just wanted to let you guys know this is probably the most this is the best part of
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2530,the debate for me because I love to come up with these what ifs hypotheticals for you all. And just to know there is no rules for here. You could talk freely. You can crack jokes in this. Any other there's no strict there's no strict.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2543,There's no strict here. There's no time limit, no whatever. I'm just going to go ahead and ask you all a hypothetical question. And then we're going to go around and just have everybody answer it. And you guys who just have fun with it.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2556,Like I said, there's no time limit. There's no rules. You don't have to be quiet and you can talk over and have fun with it. So let's get started. So you are the president of the United States and you have to pardon one of the two people.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2568,Now, partying one keeps the other one in jail. All right. And here are your choices. For the first round, you have to choose who to pardon and who do you pardon and who do you keep in jail. Bill Cosby or Harvey Weinstein.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2585,I'm going to start with our relevant. I would probably pardon Weinstein because at least he was running like a large business that he would be able to perhaps go back to at least advising how to run the business.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2599,There's like Cosby was just like some comedian. So there's something you can get out of that. Yes. He will add to our GDP at least. Yeah. At least you can respect that. This is a terrible question. No, it's not.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2616,I mean, I think. I think it's healthy people. Would you, which rate was could you let out again? Hey, hey. Hey, hey. What an old guy. What a great culture to show. I guess so. I did an old purpose.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2628,All right. Great scuff Dorio. Go ahead. I mean, I think there's only one real answer. I mean, I think yesterday or was it the day before? How we've seen was was hit with the coronavirus. So obviously keep him in jail.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2640,Keep him locked up and pardon Bill Cosby for sure. I mean, you don't want the coronavirus out there. All right. Bosti it was say you Bill Cosby or Harvey Weinstein. I hadn't thought about that angle. Actually, you know, we do have a problem with coronavirus spreading in prisons.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2657,And so to the extent maybe we would let, yeah, I don't know. That's tough. I guess my temptation is to, like Cosby, because he's older and less likely to, you know, to be able to do anything in Harvey Weinstein who is still pretty old and fragile.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2672,But who I guess is, you know, because of kind of what a relevance said. Like he could maybe get a career going again at some point. He's likely or probably to re-offend in Cosby who is, I don't know that Bill Cosby when you seem to,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2684,I don't know, even though he can see quite so well anymore. So he's probably, he's probably done for it even if he's out. That'd be my guess. Halsey, who would you pardon? Bill Cosby or Harvey Weinstein? Probably Harvey Weinstein.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2699,He ran a casting couch. He was a disease, a scumbag, a piece of shit. But at the same time, there's probably more incentive that people are going to like run him over with a car or something. I was going to say the edgy answer is to release the one who has a higher chance of being murdered.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2711,That would be the real edgy answer. I'd probably say Weinstein. We don't advocate for hero and twitch, but I know that's not a big problem, but that's it. It's hypothetical. Twitch is going crazy with that TOS, so I just want to discover.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2725,Alright, cool. Lecture fan, what say you, who would you pardon? Bill Cosby or Harvey Weinstein? Well, my first thought on this was whoever had less victims. And so I- In a video game, I said sorry. If we had fewer victims, then Weinstein and if that's true, then Bill Cosby.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2744,Okay. Brittle, the question you just dread to answer. Yeah, I'm dragging it. Well, fuck, so the thing is, I don't know the specific crime that either of them got convicted for, but they both went away, I think, for like 10 years or something like that.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2760,I don't know exactly, so I'm not sure what I'm pardoning. I gave you the sheet and I told you I said, look up who, what crimes did they commit? I gave it to you. You did not- I did not do it.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2771,You did not bother the charges. So fuck, well then I'd probably let out- Cosby, I guess probably because I don't know. I just, it's just old and I'm not sure. Yeah, probably that, I guess. Fuck. Alright, last year's the name, what say you, who would you pardon?
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2789,Bill Cosby or Harvey Weinstein? I mean Cosby who's been in jail for a certain time already, and he's older, so he's been dying sooner, and I feel like the social punishment will kind of be worse for Cosby because he was sort of so famous and beloved and he kind of betrayed
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2806,everyone in a sense. So he'll probably receive more punishment outside of jail, so Cosby, there you go. Alright, and the second round before we go to the next, what if, alright, who would you pardon? And who would you basically keep in jail?
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2824,And since Brentel didn't do his homework, we're going to go to him. So Brentel, between our Kelly and Jared for a forgo, forgo, um, Jared forgo. I can never, I'm sorry, I have a forgo forgo. Forgo, forgo, forgo.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2842,Thank you. I can't pronounce, I know how to do now. Jared forgo, who would you keep in jail and who would you pardon? Oh God. Fuck. Fuck. Uh, fuck. Shit. The child. The child. Why is there phosphorus just dropping from the fucking ground?
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2883,What the fuck is this dumbass shit coming from? Thank you. That's what I want. Fuck is wrong with your dinner? I don't know. It's some weird shit what's going on earlier. Hopefully it's like fixed now though. Why? What's up?
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2896,How you doing, Dan? I'm doing. Isn't, uh, I said this in chat, but didn't, uh, Cosby like literally drug people and rape them while they're sleeping while Weinstein like kind of did like manipulative like maybe if you fuck me, you'll get a.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2910,Yeah, it was like date rape stuff. I'm not sure which one is worth honestly, both are really bad, I think. I think Cosby seems a little bit worse. No. I don't know actually. I'm not sure. Really? That's interesting.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2924,Um, so I would. I think that people that utilize like a position of power and then present that that decision to somebody, um, that like if you want to make it, you need to fuck me. I think that's one of the most disgusting things you can do to a human being.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2935,I think it's really, really, really fucked up. It destroys you in so many different ways, I think. Maybe it's just because I know a lot of guys like an industry that do it and that drives me crazy, but I don't know.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2948,Yeah, and I guess you could say it's hard to say, but I guess if you're asleep for when you're being raped, it's not that. I mean, like, I don't know. It seems fucked both situations, but I would still think that Cosby's is much worse.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2963,Yeah, I don't know. I mean, both are really bad. Um, yeah, it's kind of hard to weigh what type of rape is worse. They could send to really weird calculus. Yes, sir. Well, like at least the girls going up partying know there's a chance they'll have sex,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2978,even if they don't want to, whereas the girl's working, but yeah, like I could send to some really weird fucking territory. Okay, let this goddamn carbon dioxide out of here. Yeah, my wife is not mail water. That's fucking really fucked up, please.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,2998,I got her sex. Boom, just kidding. Stop. She can't be that smart. Whoa. Dan. Dan. I am a fucking outstanding husband as good as they get, honestly. Yeah. If I don't say so myself. I mean, you are saying so yourself.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3017,Would your wife agree with that? I think what I think that it doesn't get better than me as a husband. Wow. I don't know how it could get better. I mean, I guess more money, better, better. Dan, I think we could think of one thing.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3030,It's just getting all I got for him. Don't listen. Sorry, what? It still works. Okay, so that's all it matters. Nice. Fuck, Rem. Oh, Dan dropping the big takes, the major league takes. The bravest takes known to mankind.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3049,I'm sick of a shit. I put them put up with them for fucking far too long. Now the gloves are off. You're going to bring them on a retirement for the seventh time. Well, who was the Jordan? Who was like the fucking basketball player that like retired like and did other sports
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3063,like 10 times in combat? Is that Jordan? Uh, I don't know. Dan, come on. You're a sports ball guy. I don't know shit about sports ball. Like fucking Charles Barkley or something. I don't even know who plays anymore.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3075,Kobe. Kobe retired permanently. Okay. All I know about Jordan is he like played what? Golf and then baseball or something? Some shit like that. But I think didn't he keep going back to or try to go back to basketball?
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3100,Dude, I'm, I saw an article the other day about like fucking magic cards and I like I played that shit when it first came out and I had binders of magic cards. I think they're pretty early. I don't know if they're alpha or beta, but they were certainly like that generation.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3118,They're not worth any money. Yeah. Well, they're worth nothing because my parents fucking threw them out like while back. I just thought they were there. I don't know. I had this. My. I haven't lived. Okay. No, I just I had this mindset that like it's weird.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3132,You still kind of imagine your shit still at your parents house even though I'm 36 at this point. Yeah. Yeah. My uncle threw away. I had the first three. It was base. Oh, what was it? Basic jungle. And I don't remember the third one.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3145,It was very the first three sets of Pokemon cards. I had a first edition set of all the cards. They weren't all mint condition, but they were all first edition. I traded so much to get all of those.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3158,I had a encased first edition Charizard. Oh, fossil. Yeah. It was like in a little case and everything. And my uncle threw all of my Pokemon cards out because he thought they were trash. That was so sad. Did you ever.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3174,Did you ever try to scam kids growing up? Oh, yeah. Absolutely. Are you? That's my. My. I'm so. I feel like a bad parent, but my my kid does that in Roblox now. And I don't know if I should scold her or be proud of her.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3189,I right now I'm saying nothing and just letting her do her own thing. But she does like the gilted armor thing like, oh, dude, there's an exploit for this item. If you fucking trade it to me, I could like give you three copies and then she she just
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3200,fucking gets the shit fucking unfriends on that or and I'm like, I want to be like, sweetie, you shouldn't do that. That's that's bad. But I'm like, yeah, fuck. Yeah, take shit in those dumb motherfuckers. So yeah, I'm conflicted.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3211,I remember that I used to. I would find on eBay because eBay was the shit back then. I would order Japanese Pokemon cards, just like worthless shit fuck Japanese cards. But a lot of kids with the local Toys R Us had never seen them before.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3225,So I'd be like, I have like these ultra rare Japanese Pokemon cards. Like this squirtle like in America is worth like 200 bucks. Like I've got a Japanese friend that my dad knows because he was in the Air Force and he went to
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3235,Okinawa like all trade since I have a few of these for like your first edition blast stories and shit and kids would actually do it. It was so fucking funny. Holy shit. Do you collect anything when you were a kid?
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3246,Just Pokemon cards. I collected absolute vodka advertisements like I cut them out on magazines and stuff. Very weird thing. I don't know how the fuck I got into that thing. How old is your eBay account? Must be nearly as old as mine at the at this moment.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3263,No, if I still have it. Charizard and backload it can't be worth more than like a few hundred bucks or some shit. I think some of those older cards like older magic cards and shit like that are actually worth
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3284,like thousands of dollars now. Oh, okay. Charizard's are 8.50. Oh yeah. This is the type of case it was in two. It was in one of these. It had like its little mint rating. It had its little name up here.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3293,Okay. The Spanish version. I don't understand. Is it stupid easy to counterfeit older magic cards? How long ago was that? 20 years ago? Bro, how amazing was the fucking anti-counterfeit technology 20 years ago? Just make counterfeits with better tech that they had.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3336,That's actually a really good question. Why the fuck do people not just counterfeit cards? I mean, especially from that long ago, I feel like you can do it and they wouldn't have a way to know. There's so many ways to spot fakes.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3351,I think that's like the same thing with like fake watches and shit. It's because they are doing them kind of in bulk and they do shortcuts and shit. But if you're going to like if you have like a sick ass printing press similar to the one
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3362,that they made the original cards and you can get ahold of original card, I don't see any reason why you couldn't make an exact clone of like a black lotus for instance. Anken printing process was wackin' unique. I don't buy that for a fucking second.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3377,This is 20 years ago. It's kind of like one of those things. I'd have to look into them more, but it's also one of those things too where people are like the lost art of like Roman like metal smelting or whatever.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3391,It's like, oh, fuck we have chemistry. We should be able to figure it out. Like, it can't be that difficult. Like there's no fucking way. Like if these were dudes were doing it back then when they were just inventing fucking plumbing,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3400,like we really can't re-engineer any of these fucking metals or alloys. I don't believe it. What does that mean about like what is it Damascus or something? Like we can't make it anymore? I don't, I'm not sure. The only thing that I know of that's hard to do.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3415,Fucking Christ. There's a lot of CO2 in here. Oh shit, close. Oh, whoa, what is happening? Bro. Oh, I know that like you have to like dig up steel from like shipwrecks to like for like finely tuned radiation instruments because after the atomic bombing like all steel above
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3441,ground is contaminated or whatever. I know that. Oh, there's so much to do to me. Oh, because these fucking pipes are all fucking full. Oh, so it's 30 years old, not even 20 years old. Why don't qualudes exist anymore?
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3462,Well, if I remember from that movie with Leonardo the Caprio, it's because they weren't that good at doing anything and people were using them recreations. I thought qualudes were like an old, I don't know what the type of drug with qualude,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3475,but I thought it was similar to like Xanax. I don't know if qualudes are like Benzo's, but you just take into like chill or whatever, but if you mix them with alcohol, they have like really bad effects on you.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3484,I don't know if that's true. I don't say yeah, I don't know if that's actually true. That was just that was my understanding. Oh, that's what happened in the Wolf of Wall Street. So I'm gonna go with they've done the research.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3496,Well, it was on Wolf of Wall Street. That's where I get all my drug education from. True. When you're really old, do you think that you'll try drugs that you would be afraid to try now? Yeah, like heroin or crack, things along those lines.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3511,I don't think I'm the state of mind to evaluate that. So I don't know. Seems weird to think that like my life is almost gonna end, so I'm gonna do some weird shit. I don't know. Seems like that a good way to, or I don't know if I can.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3522,They're barbituits. That's like a tranquilizer, right? So it should be similar-ish, right? They basically cheer you the fuck out. Thank you. Every time you destroy a single pipe in this game, all the fluid across all of your pipes pauses for a moment.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3581,Do you think every single time a change to a pipe is made, every single pipe in the game recalculates where the liquid goes? It seems really inefficient. Given the prep talk you did about food and other prep stuff,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3594,or prep talk then? Give me the prep talk. Yeah, I already told Steve, I mean, he doesn't give a shit. He doesn't take it seriously. I don't know. Like, just what do you think you would actually need? The answer is not fucking toilet paper, chat.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3614,Like, if you're going to be potentially- Why was it like an apocalyptic scenario? Well, no, it weren't. Okay, my method- Why are the apocalyptic scenario? Yeah, okay, my method isn't necessarily apocalyptic. It's like, you can't go, you can't leave your house for six months.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3629,That's the- Leave your house for six months. Yeah, because if you leave you risk infection or something, maybe the coronavirus mutates and it becomes 80% deadly, right? As an example. So under that circumstance, I try to just have that.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3646,So I try to have the main things I guess I didn't go into before. So obviously food and water- Yeah, you need some sort of- You need sustenance of food and water. You'd need sterilization for like your body and for your environment.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3658,So something to keep your environment clean. So like shit or something isn't stacking up. And then some sort of like antiseptic or like some mild antibiotics, like penicillin or something for your body. And then you would need, I maybe defense if you want like a gun
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3671,or a bat or something, and then some form of entertainment. Yeah, so you actually nailed most of the communications and other one. Oh, yeah, some sort of communication that works. Was anyone on the internet like someone who had to donate to destiny recently?
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3682,So like local radios or something, right? Yeah, so I have some examples of a few of these things. One thing that's really interesting, chat, and you guys can do this either for free or for a few bucks on a app on your phone.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3694,Download Wikipedia. Like there's apps you can just do, it's called offline Wikipedia or something like that. I don't know if it's Android or iPhone, but if shit gets really serious having access to that information where you're able to,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3705,you know, look up coronavirus or something along those lines, that's helpful, right? If the internet is out or if something, you know, if you fucking cut your leg, you might want to look up like infection or how to do this type of stuff.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3716,So that's useful and it's free. I talked about before, I have a, I have a sat phone and there's a, well, it's a sat texting device and that's cheap. It's like, it's like, like satellite maintenance and shit though, no?
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3729,Well, the satellite, the Iridium network for the most part is a little bit more robust because the satellites all talk to each other and it only really needs one base station somewhere around the world. Obviously. Those satellites usually maintained though to some extent, like kept up.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3743,Well, yeah, but that's the Iridium network. Like if cell phone towers go down, the whole point of the satellite network is that it will continue functioning. Now, if there's a global fucking shit show and everything goes out, then yeah,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3753,it's going to be completely fucking useless. But yeah, I mean, it's mostly, it's able to work off of each other. So a satellite phone is helpful, but you can't really do very fucking much with it, except like text loved ones across the country and be like, hey, day 55,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3769,I shot some looters, have two gallons of rice left. You know, I mean, that's not too much. Another interesting thing, I actually kind of forgot about this one before, but I got it recently is preventing people from even wanting to fuck with you in the first place.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3783,So if it does go somewhat mad max and you have looters, so my place was looted during Hurricane Katrina. So I had people, I wasn't there when it happened, but people were breaking into apartments and stealing everything inside.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3795,And if you are there, that's scary. So a way to keep them out is to make them think they don't want to go inside. So I got quarantine tape, like police tape, just the tape that shit all over your door,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3804,they're going to not going to go fucking anywhere near that shit. But yeah, food, water, fill up your bathtub with water, whatever. I mean, look, I don't think it's likely it's going to be like this, but I do think it's probably pretty likely that we're going to be here more than 15 days,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3818,not wanting to go outside or, you know, being forced not to go outside of that way. I'm thinking too far, I mean, maybe for a coronavirus, but imagine if the coronavirus all of a sudden had a fatality rate of 90% percent.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3830,And it was something that was like Ebola in terms of lethality, that would be really, really scary. Yeah, because it's extremely contagious as well. Like, so being being prepared for the stuff isn't too hard, but you know, it's more fucked.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3844,If you're in a city or something, you should probably try and make some contingency plans to like go to your fucking parents' house or grandparents' house that's more in the country, more suburbs. But yeah, I mean, that's it, man.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3855,Just try to stay safe and I mean, you're going to be really fucking bored, because I guarantee if it gets... I think entertainment is probably one of the most important things. You have to find something to keep yourself entertained.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3866,Yeah, so have like the little solar panel that can charge your phone, that will keep you going a little bit if you have some games on it, or you can charge your laptop off it and shit like that.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3874,But offline games, if you really like Skyrim, you can go explore all of it. There's no evolutionary advantage for COVID-19 to mutate to be more deadly. Well, I mean, I assume that when you say that, it means it doesn't have an advantage to be deadly to spread faster,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3895,but I don't think that that's how viruses work, where they only mutate to their advantage. If that's the case, no virus would ever kill it. Right? Because that's not to their advantage. They want to spread as much as possible.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3905,So just because... Yeah, the goal is just to spread. They could become very deadly, but it takes a certain amount of time for it to kill you, so it could still spread and be deadly. Yeah, COVID is like super fucking frisky,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3917,because it can go, I guess, up to 14 days without having symptoms. Up that point, you're able to spread to other people. So like, it could literally, if this thing mutates, it's something more dangerous. It could be a literal fucking population killer, unironically.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3931,So yeah, I mean, I don't know if that's likely to happen or not, but it's scary. Nothing evolves with any inherent purpose. Oh yeah, you're agreeing with me. Never mind. Yeah, sure. Why would a virus ever show symptoms?
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3959,Well, it's kind of a backwards way of thinking about it. Technically, viruses don't really want to hurt you at all. They just want to hijack a few of your cells and then reproduce. Problem is that usually, if stuff starts taking over your cells and reproducing
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3970,with them, usually you need those cells to survive. So viruses don't actually hurt you, so your immune system that's responding to the, well, the virus would hurt you if you're looked and checked, but it's your immune response to it that ends up fucking you over so much.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3981,That's where pneumonia and shit are pretty sure come from. It's like, you're immune, like the inflammation of your body, whatever. So like when you say, well, why do viruses hurt you? It would kind of be like, if a criminal broke into your house with the intention of like,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,3992,killing you or like your dad or your mom, and then like your brother comes out with like a gun to kill the burglar and then they get into a fight and you're like, dude, why are you killing the burglar? Like, just let them come in and do this shit and you'll be fine.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4002,Like, you got into a fight. Like, look at all this, look at what dumb this is. Like, the burglar shouldn't hurt you. Like, why would the burglar want to fight you? Whatever. And it's like, well, the burglar stays unchecked.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4009,He's going to fuck everything up. So like, even if we endear some damage here, that's not a great comparison because generally, violently resisting people causes more harm anyway. Well, although in some cases, your immune response are usually what kill you.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4019,So I guess, yeah, actually, that's actually more apt than I thought it was. Because oftentimes it's your immune responses that are what end up killing you in the end too. Because your immune system over-response to things and then you end up dying because you can't handle the...
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4047,These are end-gates, right? Okay. Jesus Christ. I'm so confused. Yes. All right. We got a little bit confused on that. What are we talking about again? I don't know. Okay, please. Strong back with it. Yeah. Any more tips?
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4069,I mean, firearms are probably good to have if you can do it. If you know how to use it, I guess. I mean, it's not that complicated. The point in the end goes towards the bad guy. I guess the main thing, yeah.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4092,Stay home. Do not go out under any circumstances. And also, don't attract attention to yourself so that people want to come and talk to you. He had he had he bonus me. Oh, the 40 caliber versus 9 millimeter debate.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4109,You have any insight on that one, Steve? Generally, it's 45 versus 9, but 9 is the superior caliber in every way. 40 shape and form. Really? To 40 or 45, yes. Well, I would say that 40 would have more stopping power.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4123,It could arguably the same... I don't know if I seriously doubt 40 has the same mag capacity as the 9, but like 9 is long. It's like 1 or... As long as you're using hollow points, everything is like sufficiently lethal in terms of killing
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4139,somebody. Like stopping power isn't the actual killing mechanism of most firearms. It's usually when it comes to fragmented rounds, like the hollow points. Usually it's the amount of unique and individual wound channels that are created when the bullet
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4150,enters the body, so a few shots from a 9 with hollow point rounds should sufficiently damage a target such that it brings it down and probably kills it afterwards. There's no reason to use a bigger caliber. So I think the argument was, and this was probably after that huge shoot out that the cops had
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4165,against those bank robbers back in the day and they were only using pistols, was that... Or the FBI was that 40 and better penetration going through things like windshields versus 9 millimeters, which would quote-quote bounce off of them.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4177,Okay, we're not talking about fucking shooting out with like fucking guys armed with AKs or shit. That's what I'm talking about, bro. Okay, in that case, you're not talking about 40 or 9. Get a fucking AR-14 with the fuck.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4189,No, I'm sorry, an AR-15. Oh god, I just bitened. I heard so many jokes about it. Okay, it's an AR-15, sorry. Get it, just get an AR-15, use 556 rounds, then you're good to go. And then you get your sick-ass tactical attachments, your flashing strobe lights,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4201,your crazy fucking sights. AR-15s are tight for handling. You can like quarter or two, you get a short barrel with some bullshit if you want. Like, yeah, just do that. Are you more of an AK or an AR guy?
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4211,AR-15 is by far a superior platform. AKs are like... You're gonna go with a big false. The AK is proven resilient, will not fucking break. ARs, half the time, get a little bit dirt in them, the farther stuff worked in them.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4223,AR-15s are pretty resilient, even in dirt, I'm pretty sure. AK-47s are pretty reliable, but 556 rounds are superior to the 762 by 540 rounds. That's a penetrate. AR-15s are pretty cool. 762, 39. AR-17s are really nice. 7-9s, right.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4237,Yeah, maybe, but again, you don't need to penetrate like fucking cars or whatever. AR-15s are pretty sure 556s are the superior cartridge for killing people. I'm almost positive. The tumble effect by the bullet is way better than just blowing a hole through somebody, 100%.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4252,I mean, the other main argument in a MAMAM situation is that 555 ammo is going to be way more plentiful in the United States than 762. AR-15s are pretty cool. We're out there looting, boys. Did you mention fish antibiotics?
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4268,Listen, that's more of a meme for me. I don't expect you guys to go and get every type of antibiotics for your fish and then stock it up for yourself, okay? I'm just more crazy than you. Okay, just leave it there.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4279,I'm not going to go into fish antibiotics. Oh, it masks. I have gas masks, which I didn't realize. I guess I should have. The NVC cartridges on gas masks, the B stands for biological. So those are actually really good for...
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4294,NVC, isn't that a nuclear biological chemical? Isn't that what they're for? Yeah, I just kind of... I always assume gas masks is like fucking nukes or chemical, but yeah, the B is literally the biological type of shit. Mm-hmm.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4306,But yeah, N95 masks are probably good for most of you guys. I got a bunch of them. I'm rich. Wait, you're hoarding fucking white fingers on the menu. Oh, I'm hoarding. Hey, I hoarded them before, okay? When no one wanted them, I was out there buying them for two bucks a pop, okay?
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4320,Different. Wait, how many days do you have? Oh, probably 50. Damn. They're mine. I bet you could have an hospital that could use these like... Fuck them. They're going to use them once and throw them away. They don't know the value.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4333,That's probably because that's CDC guideline is you just use them a few times and toss them. I don't think you're supposed to rewash them or anything. They're precious. Damn. I even have the N100 masks. That's right. Fuck the N95 masks.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4348,I want the hundreds. I got them too. What does N95 mean? Like stops 95% of contaminants or something or what? Yep. Okay. You just put the 100 on and you can't breathe. You're just like, Whoa. It's just fucking plastic.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4363,Here's your N100 mask right here, Dan. I think it's like 99 point something or whatever. But yeah, they're not too comfortable, especially if you have a beard. It'll say that. I don't think they're that effective as well. I don't think you'd need that much ammo in a post-apocalyptic scenario.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4379,Like a few hundred rounds will probably do it. Yeah, that's all I have. Yeah, it's not like you're going to be in perpetual fucking shootouts every single day. Like the goal would be to avoid that type of confrontation as much as possible.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4390,Yeah. Unless you literally think you're going to mad max your way through like 400 gunfights and survive every single one. Yeah. If you're a real capitalist doomer like me, you'd be ordering hydrochloroquine remdesifer in Favepivir. You need prescriptions for those.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4410,I tried to get Tammy flu after the last shit, but you need a prescription and my doctor wasn't. Tammy flu sucks shit. Don't you know everything? Listen, it was, I wanted it just in case, all right? I think Tammy flu is literally like,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4422,if you buy some god-like miracle, if you're able to identify that you have, if you're able to identify that you're coming down with the flu, if you take it right at the fucking start, I think it can reduce your symptoms to like one day.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4436,It's like such a fucking meme. I mean, don't take medical advice for me, but that's my understanding. There was a fucking panic for that shit. What was the panic? Was that swine flu? People were losing their shit for Tammy flu?
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4447,I think that was swine flu. What is the dgg shibboleth? That's going to be like Pepe or Yi or something like that. Like I scream Pepe and you say Yi from behind the fucking bushes and then we come out like we're in a fucking World War II jungle or something.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4472,We're like, yo, what's up? All right, Zomak, I read that. But I don't know if you're a moron or not. This is the problem. It seems smart. But is it? What is? People typing paragraphs and it's like, I don't know if I'm reading it from like
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4516,my eight-year-old fucking daughter or if I'm reading something from like a fucking PhD in biology or something. That's the duality of fucking dg. Oh god, I flooded my face with so much carbon dioxide. What is Devin saying about the coronavirus these days?
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4552,I think the quote-unquote worst take that I gave was that I was worried that it would end up being nothing. Like H1N1 or swine flu or evil or whatever where everybody freaks out and literally nothing happens. Even though you hear about it for like weeks.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4566,That was like the extent of my skeptical take. I think Devin went full on like everyone's overreacting. It's nothing or whatever. Devin went super hard. The Matrix said he walked back so hard I thought it was in the Matrix.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4585,Does Devin just do business streams all the time or does he play games as well? I think he mainly does like his podcast stuff. I don't think he might play games. I'm not sure he used to. I don't know if he'd still do that.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4599,God, I can't imagine streaming business shit 24-7. I would literally lose my fucking money. Every day someone sending me a resume asking me to evaluate some fucking property, cap rate or something. What did you give that take? Oh no, just right at the very beginning when we...
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4619,What are you doing up here? Oh my God, you're ruining my whole base. You stupid fucks. I haven't had this set one way you dumb fucks. Just basically in the very beginning of like the corona worries or whatever.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4631,One of the things that kind of sucks is that like if you're 30, I don't know for a lot of you, I don't know how recent this was, but I know that like we talked about like Swine Flu,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4640,Swine Flu and H1N. One of those is the same thing. Yeah. Hi guys. Oh hey, what's up? Yeah. There were like three different big medical things in my lifetime. One was the Swine Flu, one was the Ebola stuff,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4653,and then I want to say there was one other big like flu pandemic or whatever. That like... SARS? Oh maybe it was SARS or MERS or something. Yeah. That was like literally going to destroy the fucking world. And people were so freaked out and literally nothing happened in either of these.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4667,And I remember like after hearing about things like that so many times, I know that people are like super skeptical of like, you know, medical communities and they're wanting against this. And I was just kind of worried that like,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4676,man, if this ends up being nothing, holy shit. Like it's just the... It feels like the medical... Oh yeah, the bird... No, bird flu was Swine Flu, wasn't it? Um, hmm. Yeah man, I'm not sure. H1N1 killed literally hundreds of thousands.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4691,I thought H1N1 killed about as many as a normal flu season does in the US. Maybe a little more. I could be wrong. Hold on. H1N1 deaths US. Yes. Bird flu was Avian flu. Swine flu killed 500,000. 500,000 US citizens or...?
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4718,Um, I think... I'm not sure I don't think there's that many. Um, I know there's no way. No debate earlier. Yeah, because I was curious what the death rate was. And it was 12,500 deaths. Although it infected 61 million people,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4733,but the mortality wasn't so high. Yeah, I thought the thing about H1N1 I think was they initially thought the mortality of it was going to be far far higher than it was. Yeah. Oh, this is the virus. I remember that too, yeah.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4747,That one was spooky, extra spooky because it got its birth effects. Yeah, I want to say... I heard, I heard Danny, I want to say Dan, I think I have toilet paper right now thanks to you because when I heard you on that big brain podcast,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4760,I guess I just... I hadn't really found much about it, but I immediately left to go get some toilet paper and the next day it ran out and I haven't seen it anymore. I've lived since. So thanks for that.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4770,How much do you guys... When I go to the store to buy toilet paper, I just buy like two or three of those huge ass fucking dings and I never have to buy it for like months. How often?
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4778,Do you guys just buy like one or two rolls? Like I have so much in my house. I'm not gonna... I'm not like stocked up on it, but I have like so much in my house that it'll last me for at least half a year.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4786,Yeah, I guess I... I know normally for whatever reason just buy the big ones, but you know, we were running low and just every time I go to the grocery store, I look for fun and you know, it's always crazy empty.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4798,So how did you um... How much of that debate did you tune in for? Caught the ending part. Stupid. Oh god, I hate like reading lefty economic tags so bad. Anything related to housing in lefties is just so brain dead.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4811,Oh my god. Yeah, I'm getting it man. But yeah, I just I want to say thanks again for the points. Oh yeah. Sorry, yeah, I just got totally sidetracked. Yeah, yeah, there's a lot of like dumb talking points.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4824,That one is such a fucking bait and switch. 100% of legal immigrants are fucking criminals. Like whoa, holy shit, that is actually that's actually a lot of crime. Yeah, because they cross the border illegally. I'm like, oh wait, when?
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4838,There's some dumb ass semantic shit. Like in that case, like fucking 100% of American citizens are criminals because everybody's fucking jaywalked or fucking done on speeding or some dumb shit. Like what a stupid point. Yeah, that's a good point.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4849,Yeah, didn't you think that Cosby's crimes were a little bit worse than than Weinstein's? I think you could make, I think you could make that point. I mean, I just what I the reason I answered it that way was just because I figured
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4862,coffee was less likely a re-offend. You know, because he's just so old. But I mean, I think I'm not completely up to speed about what Harvey Weinstein did, but I think Bill Cosby did more harm over a longer period.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4876,So I mean, he was, I think Harvey Weinstein was coercing using his position of power, whereas Bill Cosby was literally trying them. That's really interesting that he got convicted as well. Harvey Weinstein? It seems like something that's really different.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4895,I mean, I don't know the facts of the case, but it would seem like it'd be really difficult to convict someone on a great by coercion, though. Let me see, actually. I'm not, I, let me see here. He, I mean, it may be more than that.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4906,I don't, I don't want to sell him short. Someone saying he got convicted for actual, actual rape. Yeah, I mean, it seems like this. Let's see. I don't even know how you get a fair trial. I mean, not to be weird about it, but like,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4922,if you have so many people accusing you and it's all in every single one of it is, he says that- Was it a jury trial or? Uh, I don't know. Let's see. I don't, I mean, does anyone know if there was actual evidence in any of the
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4938,name of this stuff or was it mostly, he said, she said. Oh, Dan asking the big, the big meme or question? No, I'm literally just, I don't know. I don't know anything about it. Getting a little, uh, getting a little nervous here, guys.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4949,You'd have to have, uh, you'd have to have more than, than you should have seen. He said, she said to me, you know, you're burden proof. Ideally, yeah. Beyond a reasonable doubt. Well, yeah, but what about if a thousand people are accusing you and they all have
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4961,no proof? I mean, you're probably going to get convicted, right? And that point, I mean, you know, testimony is a form of evidence. And at that point, it's for the jury to the credibility of the innocent, you know.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4972,That's, that's one reason we have, I don't know if we have- What do we have to do? Oh, hold on, I'm listening to a hard evidence clip. Give me two minutes for two seconds. You're right. I've been- I'm going to take a shower.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4984,You sit there and have a drink. You walk. Don't drink, can I stay on the bar? No, you must have me down. No. Please. I don't want to. I'm not doing anything like that. I'm sorry, I don't- No, you said it was a kind of aggressive one.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,4999,I need to know a person's name because- I wanted to do a thing. I don't- It would think please, I swear I won't just sit with me, don't embarrass me in the hotel. I'm here all the time. I know, but I don't want to.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5010,Please sit there. Please, one minute. No, that's kind. Let's go to the bathroom. Please, I don't want to do something. I don't want to. Go to the bathroom. Come here. Listen to me. I want to go to the upstairs.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5019,I'm not going to do anything. I'm going to go to the upstairs. I'm going to go to the upstairs. Get a little nervous. Yeah, get a little nervous. Okay. That's it. If you're not- If you're embarrassed, mean that's-
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5025,I'm not embarrassing you. I'm just- I don't- I don't feel comfortable. Please, I'm not going to do anything. I swear my children, please come in on everything. I'm the famous guy. I'm feeling very uncomfortable. I mean, he's coming now.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5043,And one minute and if you want to leave when the guy comes with my- I'm just- I'm sorry, just come on. I'm used to that. Oh, are you- You're still dead? Yes, I'm in. No, but I'm not used to that.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5054,I won't put it again. Come on. Sit here. Sit here for a minute. Please. No, I don't want- It's in your snout. You were a barrack. But though- I- You were falling again. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I promise you I won't do anything.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5067,I know, but yes, there was too much coming. I will never do another thing to you five minutes. Don't ruin your friendship with me for five minutes. I know, but it's kind of like- It's too much for me, okay?
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5079,Please, you're making a big scene here. No, but I want to leave. Okay. Bye. Thank you. A spokesperson for Harvey Weinstein today issued the following statement in regard to the New Yorker revelations. And it reads in full, Any allegations of non-consensual sex
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5098,are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein. Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances. Mr. Weinstein obviously can't speak to anomalous allegations, but with respect to any women who have made allegations
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5113,on the record, Mr. Weinstein believes that all of these relationships were consensual. Mr. Weinstein has begun counseling his listen to the community and is pursuing a better path. Mr. Weinstein is hoping that if he makes enough progress, he'll be given a second chance.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5122,Hey, there are a person who's having a seat. Yeah. Pretty terrible. That was like so many, like, that was like so many like abuser tactics. Make the other person feel guilty for refusing you. Try to present some sort of like dire situation.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5143,You're embarrassing me to do this. And then try to make the person feel like they're going to lose something. I'm never going to see you again. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, like make it feel like it's their fault.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5151,Like Jesus, holy shit. Yeah, even pulled out the I'm famous. I wouldn't do anything play. Oh, yeah. Jesus fuck. Like every we had every fucking checkbox there. Jesus. Holy shit. Is that what he got convicted on that tape?
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5169,Does anyone know? That's what, well, someone who chaps at it. So what do you think, Dan? So what is he fucking guilty of touching a breast? Is that it? Okay. Joe, I don't mean guilty of committing a first degree criminal sexual act
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5183,by forcibly performing oral sex on production assistant, Amy Helaie in 2006. He's also been convicted of third degree rape for attacking aspiring actress Jessica Mann in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013. Wow. Well then, there you go. I'm going to CNBC article here.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5198,Something that I would actually be curious about. In that tape, did anything illegal actually happen? Nothing actually is going on that you can be convicted of, right? I'll tell you the illegal thing is recording someone. Actually, that's actually unironically true, right?
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5213,I know. If it's a yes. It depends on the state. Well, I was going to say it already consent. Well, that's California. Yeah, in California, California is a one-party state. Huh, that's really weird. If he were to admit to the unwanted sexual contact,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5227,that'd be sexual assault. Yeah, that's... Blackmail? I don't know if that counts. Come fuck me or I'm not going to talk to you anymore. Like, everything is so heavily implied. I don't know if anything there is technically illegal.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5240,I guess if it's a jury that can make, you know, a jury is reasonable doubt, right? So California is a two-party state one person, a hand record, sorry. Okay. What did you say? Yeah, sure. Yeah. Now, I know it's kind of an interesting question,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5256,but I just figured he is likely to re-offend than like Cosby. And I think that tape is a good example of why Cosby was... I mean, he's a sky of Weinstein. And like you said, he just detected he employed.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5274,Wait, what did Bastia say that I disagreed with? Bastia said some shit that I... What was fucking ringing about? What was it? Does anybody remember? I thought that she recorded him as part of a sting job by the police.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5288,Oh, that might be it. And it would have changes. Oh, UBI, the Trump tax stimulus is not UBI. You know this, right? Yeah, I didn't... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. No, the notion of giving out check to people is...
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5301,Yeah, I mean, it's different than UBI. It's not even remotely similar to UBI. It's just a stimulus check, right? Yeah. Well, I mean, in the sense that it's not a forever program, my point in making the comparison was, though,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5311,Electropham is saying Yang is a socialist for when you get out of checks to people. I was saying that he's Donald Trump, a socialist for doing that on a short-term basis. Oh, sure. Okay, yeah, I guess. Now, I mean, if you're...
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5323,I guess I don't know enough about what... Like, if you're saying like... I guess we're saying that Trump sending out a check is different from what Yang is proposing with sending out a check or...? Yeah, of course. Having universal basic income is like a de facto policy
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5340,of the United States is far different than one or two times stimulus checks and times of crises. No, I agree with that. I agree with that. I just... I guess it's... What was annoying is... And this is something I guess I often run into
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5351,when talking with conservatives when they talk about something being socialist. And it just seems like the argument amounts to any time the government does something to help people... It's socialist. It's socialist. Yeah, it's really stupid. Yeah, not only is it...
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5363,It's... I mean, it feels really nonsensical, but it's... Any definition of socialism seems to mean something about the control of the means of production. Not just government does stuff to help people. Oh, shit. Looks like futures hit their breaker at 13% down.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5384,Wait, future markets? Can it hit breakers? Yeah. Jeez, okay. So how are you guys... Are you guys scared yet? I mean... Honest to God, I really want to watch the movie on stream contagion. Did you see that? Have you seen that movie?
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5400,I haven't seen that. The thing that I'm a little bit worried about is that like, there's a quote... Fuck, I always butch you this. But it's something like every civilization is 24 hours from like 24 hours away from violent like collapse or something.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5413,And the idea has to do with it. As soon as you can't get food anymore in supermarkets, you're like that like, shit within 24 hours will go crazy. That's something that's a little scary to me. Like if the food supply...
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5427,I mean, like just thinking about big revolutions like France and Russia, I mean, those were directly triggered. I mean, there were a lot of factors, but the firing point was always lack of food. Yeah. Oh, it's from... Oh, it's a Lenin quote, ironically enough.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5440,Every society is three meals away from chaos. Well, hey, I mean, he did... You know, they were... They were on starvation rations in Russia when he finally got his way into power. I mean, it's kind of interesting when I think about that.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5456,It's like, that's how bad things have to get before your socialist program can really come to power. Well, before any big change will happen, you probably need to get in this area, right? I mean, that is a... I mean, that kind of a big change, you know, like revolutionary change, I guess.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5474,Yeah, I don't know. I hope we're not there. I mean, I know that we... Like, some of the shortages we've had so far have... You know, they've been pretty temporary. I mean, the only thing I haven't been able to find consistently
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5487,has been toilet paper. Yeah. It's so weird. Is that normal? Did that happen? Sometimes it crisis or was this just some dumb American meme that just started and like caught on? I really don't know. It's crazy because toilet paper is...
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5503,I don't know. I don't want to... I guess there's a fallacy where everybody in national things are easier than they are, but it is hard to imagine why is it toilet paper so hard to get on the floor.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5511,So fucking weird. Like chicken, for example, I went looking to buy some chicken. It was out for a day and they had a shelf full of it today. So it's going to be all right. But anyway, yeah, I don't know.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5525,I just... If things get that bad, but that's just so hard to imagine now. I mean, as incompetent as a government can be, like the food supply is like... You know, that's something I'm sure that I can keep a handle up here.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5542,Oh, yeah, hopefully. I guess it just depends on how bad things can... Oh, I guess I just got like my 90 bottles of soil. So I'm good for at least a month or two. Did you do any emergency shopping or was that your emergency shopping?
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5554,I got some cereal and sandwich meat the other day, so I'm good for like a week. I haven't though. Maybe I should. I don't know. Going to the store is a little bit spooky. I'd say. Just there's like a line-in to get in outside
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5566,because they're only letting like 50 and at a time. It's like kind of scary. Yeah, you're in California and did the... No, I think it's talked about enforcing it with police, but I don't think actually doing that. But like all the businesses are closed down,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5580,so there's no reason to go out anyway. Oh, I see. Don't you get tired of reading the same thing, everything? No, that's my superpower. I can eat the same... Every girl I've ever lived with fucking hates that shit.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5589,Like if I live above a Chipotle, I can eat fucking 30 meals of Chipotle a month. Like 100%. I love eating the same thing, everything. Well, I don't love it, but I'll do it. I don't care if I...
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5598,It's kind of interesting. It reminds me of that like, you know, when like executive types and efficiency maxer types like to talk about, you know, this is my big secret. Wearing the same thing every day, eating the same thing every day,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5613,like less mental energy to spend on those choices. Oh my goodness, man, it's so weird today. That's one thing that's scaring me to, if the internet like actually goes out forever, I'm like super fucked. You're gonna have to become an ironic way more than...
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5634,What does that mean? I'm like charging rent to your ex-wife. Oh yeah. Do you guys think that the Trump stimulus stuff is actually gonna have a positive effect on the economy at all? 100%. It's super necessary, yeah. Yeah, I think so as well.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5656,So like, I heard you guys, I remember like, one of the conversations I wanted to get in on was a conversation about like, where you guys were thinking about like, what stocks would go up as a result of that stimulus being injected.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5667,So stocks going up or down should never be the goal of any type of economic policy. That should just be hopefully that results from the same type of economic boom that would help people as well, would be the goal, right?
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5679,Or that you have to... Of course. I'm just trying to figure out how to make money off of it. That's all I'm trying to do. I mean, if you want to make money right now, I mean, honestly, just like,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5688,is it called staggering your investments? Just like if you've got like any type of like cash, just like slowly investing month after month after month, assuming the world doesn't end, is probably your best bet of making money. You could try to time the bottom,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5700,and if you get really lucky, you'll make money. More than likely, you'll lose money by trying to do that. But yeah, I think just like continuing like, your normal investments month by month is good. Selling everything now, because you think it's going to go lower,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5711,is a really bad idea, because you could lose fucking 10 to 20% of all of your savings in fucking one day, if you fuck that up. Well, I mean, I already played the downslope, and I think at the end of January,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5724,I put all of my shit into puts. Okay, that's like not, so that's the exact opposite of what you should probably do. Unless you don't give a fuck, and you just want to go big. I mean, if you're like-
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5733,I'm drunk. How old are you? I'm 24. Oh, well, I mean, if you think you're going to make more money in the future, you don't give a fuck if you lose everything in the out of it. Theoretically, with the right plays,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5743,I mean, you could be a Wall Street Bets poster that's showing, you know, like, fucking 10,000 to 5 million, you know, like seven trades or some shit as possible. But, um- Well, I'm not trying to- Well, it's not like I'm putting that shit out in IPO.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5755,Or anything like that. I'm putting that shit in like- Well, if you're doing puts in calls, like- It's still pretty spooky, right? Well, yeah, it's still pretty spooky, but as long as you diversify, and you know where the markets are going,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5765,whether it's- You're diversified- You're diversified- You're diversified- Yeah, yeah, I did. Hell yeah. Yeah, this is such a WSB excited that I go for. What- With respect, I think Amazon's highly undervalued right now. Yeah, that's what I was looking at as a little pig.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5780,Exactly. Right now, they're in a bit of a shock mode, but Amazon's doing- Is dumping so much into hiring right now. Yeah. It's gonna take off. I think it's gonna be a thing. I don't think- Investing in Zoom is gonna be a long-term success,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5793,but Amazon seems pretty undervalued right now. All the fangs do, but no early Amazon, because of how key they are to delivery. Yeah, I don't- I think when these consumers get the checks, if they're gonna spend it anywhere,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5804,they're gonna probably spend it on Amazon, if they're gonna even spend it on- I mean, Amazon hasn't even dropped below, like where it was, like six months ago. I don't know. Is Amazon really that- Yeah, is Amazon really that fucking-
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5816,Well, I mean, same with like one more- This is gonna be the meridian as well. This is gonna be an idea for delivery. I think that's gonna be big. Yeah, I mean, nobody's gonna want to go outside, and what are you gonna use to be able to buy your notes?
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5828,Well, but you're also making the assumption that the delivery is going to continue to function. Like, what if Amazon actually can't deliver? Like, when I tried to order shit earlier today, it's taking me like three weeks to get some shit.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5839,What if Amazon actually like gets fucked a little bit? I think the noble thing is going to be is, who else is gonna be doing deliveries? And further, of the things that are gonna be surviving outside of the extreme situation,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5853,of the things that are going to be able to ride out life right now and come out looking pretty strong, it's gonna be Amazon. Partially, partially, if this work-from-home experiment won't quote-unquote, works really well for a lot of companies,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5866,they might start shifting to that, and who's the big cloud people? Well, I don't know. I'm not totally sold on a work-from-home shit. Maybe we'll see, but like, work-from-home is one of those things that always sounds good, but like, just from my second-hand experience,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5881,I'm hearing people talk about it. The reality is, is that people are just way less productive when they're at home and not in an office. Now, like, some companies have tried to do that work-from-home shit, but at the end of the day, people actually like
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5890,just going into work, being able to work there, and then going home and then like having that separation. That's what I've heard. I don't know if that is like going out. It works- It's interesting. I agree. I can only speak for my own experience
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5904,for I can say that when I do work-from-home, if I have something I really focus on, then I can be super productive, because I can just stay there for as long as I need to. But if I don't have a clear focus that day,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5916,then it can be harder to be productive. The situation I've always found just when working from home is, for some people, it can be quite productive, but the issue ends up being, it's a lot of people, they do need some social motivation to work,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5929,and so they feel lonely, that loneliness can often relate to other things. That's why the works- like the we-work workspace experiment was kind of interesting, because it kind of combined a pseudo office space with working from home kind of.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5942,But just since so much of it is just at least subleasing upon sublases, there's just so low profitability in it consistently. Hey, Dan. Hi. Hey, what's your in Miami, right? Correct. What's, I've got my mom lives in Miami,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5960,and she's kind of- I'm sorry, Nerman. She's telling me it's pretty, it's getting kind of crazy. Is that your reading of it? You'd have to go outside to get a gauge on that of rule number one of not catching the viruses.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5980,The interesting thing- But it's not- I did go to the supermarket. It's not like Steve's supermarket experience, so I can tell you that. The interesting comparison I saw is how Southern California and the places that were hit by Sandy Hook-
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,5995,I'm not Sandy Hook, the Hurricane Sandy are handling it slightly better, just because the reality is like there's a perspective on natural disasters that's just some places you don't have. I was listening to the stream- stream. I don't know if you're from Florida,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6010,the memories always go to the various hurricanes, and this is kind of different. Different. There's an effect, especially if you're looking to the post of the hurricane. Like I think that's where the mindset is going to be for a lot of people.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6020,The fearful thing is what happens if this goes on for like more than two months? That's where we're going to start risking into some risk stuff. Honestly, even just one month seems unimaginably catastrophic. Like holy shit. The comparison ends up being it's like one month was how long-
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6036,At least if we're looking at the broad- Can I get a DG on ban? Was how long does it feel like water and power for the most part? Outside of the extreme cases for like Hurricane Sandy, or like the North or George Quay,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6047,or something like that. Like that's the comparison. If it like from there, it's more like just testing places in the country that have never gone through that. Like if you're from North Texas, you don't get time like multi-month long disasters like this that happen to you.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6061,And this is affecting everyone. Well, which is kind of unique. The other thing is going to be boredom. Now, I imagine assuming not told a collapse that there will be Wi-Fi, there will be power, there will be hot water for most people.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6073,But boredom, unemployment, that's the scary thing. It's going to start affecting people. Because regardless of how good or bad the healthy American body is, if we have 20% unemployment, because of a shock to the market, that's going to be scary.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6092,Oh sure. Crime and shit will probably go up pretty fucking dramatically too. When you say crime, or you suggest like all of the Mad Max looting stuff, or you just... Oh no, I just like in general, I think that when people aren't working and have nothing to do,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6108,like isn't that usually when opportunities to commit crime generally rise? It's kind of like unemployed people, or people that are very poor, oftentimes have a lot more trouble than a wet lot, just because fucking is one of the only things you can do with this not much else.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6120,The 2008 recession, Dan Corlect was to an ink, noble increase in crime outside of suicides and murder suicides. You know, that's kind of interesting. I was just doing some reading and apparently, apparently during the Great Depression, crime did not necessarily rise.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6144,So maybe we don't have to worry about that. During the Great Depression or the recession? I'm looking at the Great Depression because I think that was the last time we got this level of something like 20 percent, but I'm going to read this a little more in my child now.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6160,I think the scary thing is, if this is the extreme economy, and it's essentially this reverberating of what it is, this could be revealed that more of America or the world didn't really recover from the 2008 recession, that 20 percent jobs was all generated by the global employment.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6179,That's the scary thing. If 20 percent of Americans' jobs aren't essential, it could be dumped a second. There is enough cash in the economy. That's the scary thing. That's the long term danger we're looking at. From what I'm looking at here,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6194,during the Great Depression, when I'm employment at 25 percent, the crime rate many cities went down. National crime stats weren't as useful in the 30s, but studies of local police records and individual citizens by scholars like Jan Elder,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6205,Glenn Elder generally found reduced crime. Among the explanations offered is that unemployment and poverty were so common, the Great Depression of Families became closer, both themselves and mutual support, and kept young people who might be inclined to criminal behavior
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6217,under constant untold supervision. But some people say because families are weaker and children more independent, now we wouldn't see the same effects though. But, you know, check it out and drop the link there if anybody's interested. So maybe it maybe wouldn't bring everything down to help.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6235,Do you really think that we could bear this for like more than a month? I just, I mean, if the if the government is really going to be providing checks to people to pay for their basic essentials, maybe it's just tough.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6249,I mean, what's tough to know? One of the scary things is, now you can debate how legal or ethical, moral this is a skip out past that if the government policies are being, we won't give checks, but we'll give a massive tax right off,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6264,or we'll give a massive unemployment insurance benefit. That could work in terms of like helping people, against what, but the bigger issue ends up being like, what percentage of the American economy isn't in, doesn't fall under that. Like how many people aren't employed in a way,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6279,it's where they get unemployment benefits, or if that matter will percentage of Americans don't pay up taxes, they get that kind of right up, or if that matter, what percentage of Americans aren't considered legal citizens of the United States,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6288,and don't give those benefits. What happens to those people? That's the spooky part in terms of like, examining how the ride up will happen, who gets left behind, etc. On the other hand, this is kind of a very interesting true test of the moment with UBI and stuff like that.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6308,Like there are talks of a lot of people up and down on various policies, right wing, left wing, and they're really cool about talking more about pauses on invictions or housing. All right, so, wait, didn't we already do,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6322,don't we have a 60-day pause on that, or was that just a polite request from? Well, when the president said the, I think that, you're talking about the president, I think it was just a word. Ben Carson, I think, the hard guy came out.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6333,That's her federal housing. Yeah. Federal housing. That's her FHA, okay, nevermind. Yeah, Dan can still kick people out. Yeah? Well, I don't know what's going on in Miami, but it depends on your state. Certain cities are ordering different things,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6348,Californians or different states ordering different things. Further, the reality ends up being, being like, there's law and there's power. To use Dan as an example, if Dan wants to kick someone out of their home, what's he going to do?
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6362,The cops are probably going to be too busy. Well, I don't think we broke down that much. Yeah, right. Well, no, it's not, well, no, but it gets into kind of like, a practical, like, let's just say this goes on for two months.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6375,So that's the not conservative, but that's kind of a moderate estimate. If we're not looking at the extreme, if you want to kick someone out of an apartment next week, because you own it or whatever, and you've got good legal reason,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6386,how you can do it. The reality is, like, if you go out and get the court documents, the documents, the courts are currently either paused or unlocked out. Yeah, but the reality makes that even harder than, that makes it even harder to kick somebody out, right?
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6397,Like, it's pretty, like, evicting somebody, especially in California is already like a pretty arduous process. It's like three months, isn't it? We'll start to finish. Yeah, well, that's what I'm pointing out. Like, even if you start evictions right now,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6409,like, it's going to take high to the point where the crisis is going to be over. We're assuming it's not an extreme one. If we're looking at, like, a, quote, moderate to small crisis. Now, in theory, Dan could go over there
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6422,and demonstrate his second amendment, cowboyism, or whatever, but I'd much have success for that will be. What do you think about the idea of nationalizing the airlines? Myself, personally? Like, I don't like the idea of nationalizing businesses, but like, it's so hard to keep an airline afloat.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6440,And like, they're constantly going bankrupt and shit. Hope you are doing well, buddy. The reality is, we can either have a cap and open market where people are going to be allowed to fail, and we're saying to accept that these airplanes fail
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6453,for like two or three months, we might not have air travel in the United States because they all fail. Well, that's not acceptable. Exactly. In the same way, it's not acceptable for like your... I think I would be okay with one government sponsored airline,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6468,actually, that's kind of... Yeah, and that's the basis, you know, and that would be like the spirit airlines, the spirit... The public option for flying? Yeah, exactly. Well, here's... If I may, so the theory behind... There's two examples about how nationalization
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6484,or like utility formats of national policy. You can go for like the British theory of it where it's like, look, all the things we believe are required for the economy, rail system, we just own it. And that's it, because the reality is,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6498,it's really hard to develop rail lines without the government basically sponsoring and paying for it. Like, there aren't a lot of private lines, essentially, in theory, without doing... Fill the capitalist duck or sea. You can do that. If you want some luxury stuff,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6510,put your luxury trolleys in wherever... However, if you want to try experimenting experiment, but we believe this is valuable because trains, trains, sponsor transportation, with sponsors, the economy, which allows more private tourist places to work, more hotels, etc, etc, etc.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6524,That's one system. Or you can kind of go for like... It's not that you're a molly more, but it's essentially... It was just written as experimental... Experimental capitals or experimental monopoly where there's sort of the control. So the control would be America owns one airline,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6539,and it says, okay, based on business system, we're going to have this minimum, we're going to have... And our goal will happily put one plane every day to and from what every location of note. An interesting thought... And I was experimenting from there,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6554,my plan of different models of cheaper, higher end, or faster, etc. I guess it's just... If these airlines... I know that right now we're in an emergency situation, but I mean, presumably you're not just talking about the duration of the emergency, right?
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6568,Like we're talking about beyond that, right? The privacy. The privacy. And presumably we want to nationalize, and we want to keep them afloat with loans or whatever. And if we're talking about beyond that, if we're talking about non-emergency conditions,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6580,then maybe these airlines going under selling their assets to somebody else who might run them more efficiently, potentially new airline companies. Maybe that'd be a good thing. That doesn't seem to be the case that it's just like, oh, they suck at business.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6594,Like it seems like the idea of keeping an airline afloat is just very fucking hard. You're captive to so many different things. Like price of oil can fuck you. Like different air related incidences can fuck you. I don't know, it just seems like a really...
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6607,I mean, historically speaking, these companies go in and out of business all the time, they're incredibly expensive to run. That's kind of... Some things just aren't market profitable. I imagine they will. Well, the question is... Which society would tolerate?
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6622,Which side would tolerate? Well, I'm sure in theory we get a private police force, which everyone pays insurance for. Like we could do that in theory. We give a private police force where you need to have your insurance,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6632,hell, we get competitive bids. Maybe someone will come in and disrupt the private police force market with like robots. But if you're a mayor of a city, do you want to say, you know what, guys, no more public police force.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6645,It's privatized now. I'm opening up the market market for like a private... I think the good example is that... Is school buses, believe it or not? Like you can take your kid to school yourself, or you can have them carpool or I don't know,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6659,maybe there's like luxury services there. But you know, that's transportation paid for by the government. And I think a lot of people would probably, you know, like Stephen would fly on fucking Trump airlines all day because he didn't do a fuck if he's completely cattle class doing it.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6674,Yeah, I don't give a fuck. I fly cheapest fuck boi. You know, maybe the opportunity then is for other airlines to serve, you know, more exotic routes or have more luxury doing it. And that would allow them to maybe not be so much of a race to the bottom with each other as well.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6690,If this... I don't know. Exactly. You know, not every airline is a crime. I love you, man. Like for example, Southwest Airlines apparently has been probable for most of its 40 years of history. It seems like a lot of the little airlines.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6702,So the old... All right, yeah, but it's not about crises. We're talking about crises. I mean, it's just worth considering that maybe airlines are more... Well, not maybe. They definitely seem to be more sensitive to crises than other industries.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6714,Maybe there should be some regulatory response to that. But you know, when it sounds like nationalization would be kind of a re-regulation bear travel and prior to the deregulation of bear travel, deregulation meaning taking about or being an monopoly function,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6726,not just getting all the rules out. Prior to that, tickets were high. Air travel seemed to be kind of an efficient because flights were often like half full. And tickets were like expensive, so this is what I mean by the price is being high. And now air travel,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6741,you know, apart from during weird emergencies like this is pretty cheap. You know, a lot of people are able to fly that weren't able to fly before. So I don't know that basically reimplementing a system that we used to have in some fashion.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6753,They were quite nationalized, but they operated at least the public utilities. Do you know that airports themselves are privately owned or owned by individual states or cities? It's complicated. It varies very much. So it gets into more complicated with how the FAA works.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6773,It varies almost per state per airport. Some other... They're not... It's a fucking mess, but... But airports are under public state. Yeah, but well, the airports are, but the different place like the plane, like the air companies, like they bid for the spots.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6791,No, no, but I was just looking at real quick, just for it to qualify what Bassier was saying, even looking at the times when Southwest is barely profitable, these guys are posting like profits of like 500 million dollars
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6802,when they've got revenues in excess of like 14 billion dollars. Like this is such a razor fucking thin margin. Like this is not... 500 million of profit in 14... 14 billion? Like 500 million profit against... That's right. Against 14 billion revenue.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6816,That seems like such a razor thin fucking margin. Like why would I invest in this over any other business? Look, I'm a firm believer. Either make it like be kind of socially, whatever you want to call that, like make the public option.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6831,Yeah, you can make it. Or let it fail. Either like if... I'm liking it. This might be the death of Southwest Airlines. I don't know. Letting it fail is an option for this many gods. Yeah, I was going to say in this circumstance,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6844,I don't think letting it fail makes too much sense economically. Like under normal conditions, if we were just operating day to day, sure letting it fail, I think could make a lot of sense. But right now, I think we definitely need people to stay employed
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6858,by pretty much any means necessary that we really can. I'm just sure to let the... You're ready. I'm curious what the average profit margin for businesses is. Like I know that... Isn't it supposed to be 10 to 20% for most capitalist firms?
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6872,Like profit should be relatively equal throughout like an entire market. Because capital should flow to the most profitable sectors. Of course, yeah. I know that I, for example, with the public utilities that I often, you know, spar with, they have around 10%.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6887,The state gives them about a 10% profit, you know, generally. You know, that fluctuates, but that's general that the state won't guarantee them. Fuck, I'm really curious. What is like the average profit of like an American company? Financial database for 212 different industries,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6908,the average profit margin for the most recent quarter was 7.5% and the median profit margin was 6.5%. Okay, that's a little bit lower than I thought. It looked like these guys were... Southwest was running what you want. I just divided 14 billion by 500 by 14 billion to get about 3.5% profit margin.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6926,Which, you know, I mean, I guess that's half the average of other businesses there. You just have to think of it in terms of... I don't know, maybe it's not a good way to think of it, but I think of these in terms of capital markets.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6937,Like, if I have like a massive industry that's returning like a 2-3% profit, and then everything else in the market seems to return like twice as much, like why would you invest in businesses? Yeah, I don't know. I mean, that's a little beyond my wheelhouse, but...
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6952,So the... I'm not sure though that that therefore means, you know, we're all not profitable enough, you know, therefore because one is... This part of the industry that seems to be able to be profitable is not profitable enough,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6963,and then two, because the legacy or the older airlines have continually had problems, therefore, you know, nationalization would make it better in some way. Well, it's just like... You need some kind of incentive to innovate, and if the profit margins are so slim that like innovation,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6980,it seems like dramatically like, oh, you'll get like $100 more a year. Like, it's something that we might need to take a look at as to whether or not like a public option to keep competitive, keep the private businesses competitive,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,6994,or just to simply give people... It just can't stand being in the private sector, like it should be on the table, I think. Yeah, the public option is interesting, because I think most countries do have a like flagship airline.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7009,I think the United States... Most major companies do. And you... I think the United States is unique in not having one, and then also having several competing airlines. So, I mean, it is... I just... The one thing with the public option,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7025,and I mean, I'm sure this is a case in healthcare too, and just I know that healthcare is such a mess. It's quite worth it, but is that it... Depending on how it's set up, you know, I'm just thinking about the energy stuff I work in,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7039,when there is a quote unquote public option for energy, and that public option does degrade the competitiveness of the competitive entities. So... There is a difference between piping... And that's not the same, I think. Yeah, very... Based on the engineering of America,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7057,the infrastructure, it's much easier to allow you to choose where your electricity comes from than where you're... than who and what and how your airplanes are run. It's very different. Well, my point is just to say that the public option has some benefits,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7069,that the competitive option can never have. Like the public option can always be refreshed by tax revenue, the public option, you know, therefore can... The public option can kind of socialize some of its risks, whereas the private option really can't,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7082,although I know they're all trying to do that now, by getting bailouts. I mean, at what percentage of bailouts and government subsidies and tax breaks does it count as basically a government operation that just has private profits? That's a good question.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7095,That's a good question. And I say that on behalf of energy, and further the interesting thing about energy is like, yes, there might be a company X that doesn't... that does receive a ton of prop, doesn't receive a ton of subsidies,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7107,but like the energy that comes... like if they're doing oil, certain a lot of oil drilling is subsidized to paying what's going on, or you could if you're getting into foreign policy, like our relationships with certain countries subsidizes the price of oil,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7118,or natural gas, or further property. But like this is how... like not to get full with full statewide, but most markets exist because of the state. No, I agree. You can't have capital. Well, I think I agree. I believe you can't have capitalism on that,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7135,a bigger estate, absolutely. More, I should say most markets exist because a local elected leader can be... if abuse can be rallied around tool challenge and use democratic power to challenge those markets. I don't know if that's why markets exist,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7150,or that's how markets can exist, but I mean, that probably does help. I'm just... Swinging will take like the fortune that comes with them. Well, here's a bit of a mind-blowing take. We did have a sort of regulation
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7165,after the government bailouts of Wall Street in 2008. That regulation was the buildup of a quote radical left or right wing in America under the Tea Party, and what looks like now, that was the furloughed ground of the early standards movement.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7180,Those people now don't are anti-government Wall Street bailouts. And because of that, there is a social reaction to these things. Sometimes it's policy oriented, and sometimes when the policy doesn't come to solve those problems, other things happen, and that other thing could be the Tea Party rises,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7196,or the Communist rise, or whatever. Yeah, that is the thing. The problem is not... If the problem is to solve, there will be people that rise that who will say, I will solve the problem. Yeah, that always spooks me about that kind of thing,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7208,I guess that I'm most scared of assuming our infrastructure doesn't collapse is just extremism that comes from a 20% unemployment rate. Like the last time we had a real fascist movement in this country was... Yeah, great depression. Wait a minute, you're Mr. Markets.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7228,This is a reality. My absolute. There's economic markets, there's economic markets, and there's social markets. So in South America, the economic markets answer the problem, the social markets answer the problem. I mean, I guess I'm not sure where you're at.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7242,Well, here's a classic example, everyone you'll recognize. I'm not really sure what the point you're making is. One out here. A lot of people talk about them, because extreme right-ing left-wing media arose. Whether we're talking about Mr. Hassan or Stephen on one side,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7262,or if we're talking about Alex Jones, they became popular because the demands of that left-wing or right-wing, or whatever that policy perspective interest wasn't answered on a major broadcasting network. Okay. Yeah, but I mean, I don't know that that...
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7279,Well, no, but... I don't know that that means that the major broadcasting was doing something wrong. Well, no, but they... Well, I mean, we'll proportionally, a lot of cable shows, their average audience is like... Like, maybe half a million in people,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7295,if you look into the numbers on these things. Like, it doesn't take a lot to get to be proportionally sized. I think, famously, the New York Times has a rear ship of, I think, 2 million. That's massive in contrast,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7314,but if you know your way around multi-media marketing, that's not massive. You can build that with a network of other stuff. So, what I'm gonna explain is like... Yeah, how does that connect with the nationalization of industry? Well, like, look, it's not nationalization of industry,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7335,it's a demand peak. If there's a problem peak that affects enough people's lives, people demand to be solved. If a lot of people are being affected by this problem, a lot of people demand solved. If the democracy, essentially.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7347,When if the currently did visual, he doesn't have enough people who oppose him, because he's not solving the ex-problem, and people being affected by ex-problem come and dress off that problem, by electing another person who claims that's not the problem,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7360,that's how this works. Like, democracy is kind of the marketization of like social force. It's an alternative to incentive... Oh, okay....around a Roman general to come and do a coup, e-raly around someone to come and vote into office.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7372,Yeah, yeah, I get what you're saying. Well, I guess I do tonight. I guess to go back to the airlines, I think that looking at what things were like when we had a more nationalized, it wasn't exactly nationalized.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7386,Well, it wasn't nationalized, but it was a government monopoly. Government came out monopolies for different groups. I think the outcomes were worse, and I would like to avoid that unless we got some real reason to think that this time around nationalization would be better,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7402,because in the past, it seemed to be inefficient and to serve fewer people than the system. However problematic it may be in terms of having a bailout out, and it provides air travel more people and cheaper prices. Bostia, are you opposed to a government forced quarantine?
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7424,No, in fact, I know that a lecture fan, for example, have been making a point that it's unconstitutional, but I don't think that's not the case at all. The United States has had quarantines for health, really, a quarantine entire history before the revolution in 1776,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7440,and after, and it's certainly constitutional state law for the state to lack and down. The states have what you call plenary police powers, which is to say those powers not specifically reserved to the federal government the states have.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7457,There's a saying that I think really is important, remembering times like this, which is to say that the Constitution is not a suicide pact. Well, and you read it in such a way that we can't resolve disease epidemics,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7467,then you read it in a way that the country has to fall to pieces, and that can't possibly be- One of the things that really bothers me too is that when you talk about is it really constitutional for Trump to enact emergency powers to do
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7481,fucking tariffs or build a wall in the border? The answer these guys always give is, well, this is a time of crisis. It's for the security of the nation, so we're going to flex the fuck out of our presidential authority here.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7492,It's like, okay, but this quarantine shit isn't like- You're really going to tell me that the fucking building the wall is a literal fucking national emergency, or that we need a tariff of training, because that's a national emergency, but the quarantine shit isn't like-
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7504,I don't know. Throw up in a game of leak. Fuck Bob 7. I don't know if we've ever had a national quarantine in the past. I would think it's still probably constitutional because I basically have the reasons we just discussed.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7520,I mean, that's the ultimate kind of national security situation. There's certainly a commerce clause argument there, where this is crippling our- An exit tariff. Our national commerce, right? This isn't one of those attenuated commerce clause arguments. It has literally brought our economy to a halt.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7535,So that's, I think, a pretty clear national argument. But I guess beyond that, one of the reasons that the president has so many of these quote-unquote emergency powers is that, especially during the Cold War period, the presidency was given a concrete grant of the presidency huge amounts of
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7550,discretionary power to do things like impose tariffs and to make national security distinctions. And now we're seeing kind of the fruit of that in irresponsible hands. Yeah, I don't know. I just wanted to get your take on it because I think you'd be one of the only people that I would
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7569,actually talk to that would probably oppose it because of the liberty, your respective freedom. But I like your answer. I do think that freedom is something that is often overlooked anytime somebody can say, well, empirically, your freedom results in something worse.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7588,So get fun. But notion, though, that I think at one point he had said that it would be better to fight this quarantine and die than submit to this kind of reach of federal power. And it's just like, no, this is certainly a, I think he can certainly make a strong
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7610,constitutional case even for a federal quarantine. The only time, and I think with the coronavirus, it could be pretty clear, too, because we know at this point, basically the incubation period, it seems to be about 14 days. So if you wanted to say, if the federal government wanted to say,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7628,all right, we're shutting it down for two or three weeks, stay in your homes except for these properly tailored exceptions, health care workers and police, whatever other people you want to exempt, then provided you properly tailored the quarantine to the disease and made the reasonable exceptions
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7652,where necessary. I think you could then defend that in court and say, look, this was a reasonably tailored exercise of the police powers that we as a government fundamentally have to have, right? But the Constitution doesn't say anything about, well, you can form a police departments and
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7665,arrest people and things like that. But those are intrinsically necessary for government, right? Like that's basic police powers. You have to be able to do that kind of stuff. So it's certainly part of it. And I think a quarantine is the same thing.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7681,The interesting question is, I think, how extreme are you willing to go? Federal quarantine is tough, for example. Like if a state doesn't want to go along with your federal quarantine, the federal government has to enforce it itself.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7696,And like we've seen with the drug laws and the immigration laws, that's kind of tough. If the states don't want to help the federal government enforce federal law, states cannot be obligated to help the federal government enforce federal law.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7708,They have no responsibility to do that. So like if a state says we don't care about marijuana, then the federal government can still arrest you, but there really aren't that many active federal police out there enforcing federal law.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7724,They often work with state agencies to do that. So without that local cooperation, a national quarantine might not mean much anyway. Let me present the situation. If California, for example, says, okay, we're going to a really intense quarantine,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7739,all cities in California will have a pass. You need to register online to get approval to go out to a supermarket or so for certain days. There's going to be, you'll have to be home as your night or night or police will arrest you.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7754,But in exchange, just say we've done the math, we're fairly sure it's going, we can guarantee it's only a two month long process versus say Texas, not to be stereotyped, it says no, like nothing, no requirements so long, but it goes on for six months.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7770,If we're just looking back in the future, which they would prefer to have been in. Wait, wait, wait, that's why I hold on. I was going to ask the question. I go for the two months. So like Texas, I mean, California does, okay, we're going to do the extreme quarantine
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7794,short of like shooting people who are walking on the street if they refuse to surrender. We're going to go all the way with it that passes the whole shebang. Wuhan, China, basically. And let's just give us the benefit of history or whatever.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7808,It reduces it down to a two to three month long process. Texas on the air hand partially because like people have guns there, it's a little hard to enforce it, but it's a much more rural state than some parts, but still,
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7817,just for plain sister type Texas says no, we're just going to keep doing what we're doing. We're just going to ask people to behave. It's always we're going to ask people to beat do certain things, things, but we're not going to manitate anything outside of anyone doing
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7828,breaking any normal laws. And let's just keep it simple. Play it with the theory of it, California makes their time only two months. Texas, it takes six months. I guess of two months. I'm going California. Yeah, but like if it's.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7848,But we're talking like full National Guard or cops are on. I don't go outside of my house. That's really tough. I mean, because. Wuhan, China. Yeah, I mean, I guess it works. And it's just kind of spooky, I guess, because as much as I am often tempted to laugh at this kind
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7869,of point, like, you know, they do have a point that the Patriot Act once implemented didn't go away, and the National Surveillance Program expanded and maybe like after the, well, I'm sure after the two month period, this kind of National Guard on every street sort of scenario you're describing
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7883,would be rolled back, but like when it all be rolled back. And how many more lives do you save with six or with two or three months over six months, you know, side. That's that's a tough one to answer.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7894,I mean, in the short sharp period, like it's easy. I guess it's easier for me to envision 14 days here with the coronavirus. It doesn't seem like a enough time to really build a serious, a serious lasting regime.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7908,You know, of curtailment of individual freedom, but two to three months. I mean, I don't know. That's that's tough. So you're so basically your concern is you're afraid they wouldn't relinquish the power. Not exactly. I don't want to.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7925,It sounds conspiratorial to say, but just the longer it goes and becomes normalized. And I mean, if two or three months is what you need to stop the disease in the same way that it seems like 14 days is for this one, then I guess that's that's what you do.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7938,But I would at least it would depend on it basically for me. It would depend on the specific disease issue, like for the coronavirus now, but for another hypothetical virus that would burn for two months, maybe. Maybe. Well, what if we went in more extreme?
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7956,Six months in California for like they went full Wuhan control versus a year. Texas just continued with what it was. Like it's like, well, we're not going to really stop anyone from getting Taylor or whatever. But please don't do anything dumb.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7972,It has to just depend on the disease at that point because that is such a that is so hard to just. Well, not to play into fears here. We don't step we still don't fully understand what it is.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7985,Let me bring up something really interesting here. Why the fuck is gold falling in value? This is the first time this shit has ever happened. We're in a fucking crisis. Gold is supposed to be going straight to fuck up and instead it's crashing.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,7998,It doesn't make any goddamn sense. Precious metals are only sold to conservative boomers as a fucking meme and in a great time of crisis, nobody actually fucking wants to die. There are no boomers left to buy gold. It doesn't make sense.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8012,Gold was supposed to be the only ass that never worked. In every other crisis, hasn't it been that gold rises when everything else goes in the shitter? Like what the fuck? Probably I thought gold was more check on US inflation than any other type of like actual
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8025,financial crisis. Like did gold rise that much in 2007 after that? Just look at the fucking crisis. Gold historical value. So does anybody have any idea what a gold is dropping at value? Like literally any idea. It might be just people speculate on it.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8045,Didn't the speculation didn't match and that's it. It could just be a hiccup of like the past two months. I guess. Seems weird that we don't have like. I mean that's basically the total toilet paper thing. Like you realize like there's there's gonna be enough toilet paper guys.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8063,Like make sure you've got some in your house but like will be enough. Gold's not even gold. Don't worry. Isn't even hitting Altim high so like fucking 1980. Wait gold is shit. Oh gold is supposed to hold its value for like a long period of time.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8076,It wasn't a whole value for shit. Like it's been going on. No like if you bought gold in 1980 it's like worth less than it is today. Like I'll probably wait for me unless is that adjusted for. Oh no that's 1980 was the highest it ever was.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8091,It was 1630 back in 1980 and now it's like 1530. How shit. What was it during like the depression? I went and got up to 2200. It's with way less. During the during the depression there was there were controls on gold.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8109,Oh yeah you're right. So you really don't have a value of that even. Yeah not that. You can't eat gold. Why would you invest in gold? Gold is gold is a good point. It's it's a it's something you speculate on because other people speculate on it.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8120,Everyone collectively speculate on something. Yeah but all precious metals are amen. Well platinum has some uses industrial. Fuck off. Nobody that buys platinum is making fucking drill bits or some shit. That's when you talk to gold orders like well actually on the circuitry on microchips
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8135,is actually quite useful to have gold around like motherfucking you know I'm fucking pretty. I think it's like a basement got out of here. Okay platinum is probably a little bit different than gold in that aspect. It looks like silver so the price is pretty much indicative of the rarity of it
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8149,and the fact that it has uses outside of it. It's not like anyone's like oh shit. Look at that they don't even know if it's silver or you know or platinum. I would say half the time so I would say the value in that case has to be
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8159,maybe certain parts bevel and good but probably just due to the rarity and the fact that it's used for other applications. I could still use in catalytic converters and shit. Well gentlemen I gotta get I gotta get to bed so I can go work from home tomorrow.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8175,It was a pleasure talk with all you and thanks again. Pleasure. See y'all. Bye. When the fuck are you gonna play doom eternal again with moot dude? Mood is on the fucking mood schedule which means he's always doing random
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8187,shit or moving or fucking cooming or fucking doing some shit. Maybe we play tomorrow. Do I have anything tomorrow calendar? I'm not hip and twitch culture is is cooming when I well I can guess it is. If you switch up the vials.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8201,Yes it is. Yes it is. How do you guys have the time? Oh Mr. Mitten so busy man he's a bundle of love and he wants to give it to anyone who asks so. So that's how. There you go.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8217,Cool. Oh fuck I got a debate tomorrow with coach red pill. Oh boy. But you not what you know what you're doing day to day you just like update your schedule and then you'll look at it and be like oh fuck I gotta do like 8,000 things tomorrow.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8234,It's like that's really how you go about your schedule my guy. I have a lot of shit scheduled. Yeah what do you think I have like every single thing in my head every single day of the week with the
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8242,fuck. I don't know dude I mean you have pretty good memory no can't you just remember that shit just forehead that bitch. Just a real question irrelevant what the fuck is wrong with you. Sometimes I wake up at weird hours or I'm up insanely late it's like fucking four in the morning
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8257,I get up in a relevance like well guys I'm starting to stream up 4am what's happening like if you are ever here and there's no one online on twitch look to the left at who's fucking streaming and it's gonna be fucking irrelevant there and he's gonna have like
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8269,a bunch of lefties he's yelling at me like where the how are you guys not sleeping. I don't get it. I wake up when I search stream dude I literally hop out of bed search stream that's what I do.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8280,What do you mean by the guy that sounds I mean it's dude it's amazing dude tell me okay hold on you can hear on a fucked up sleep schedule if you wake up in a relevant streaming that's when you know that your life is fucked up if he's on when you're.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8293,Dude okay I mean I gotta have some support in the chat or something about this playing video games at night is far superior they're playing video games during the day. Somebody's got it with me. Yeah it's true. I'm sure but like that sure that's like saying eating at four in the morning is like the
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8309,life it's like oh man 24 hour dennies is like your lifestyle. So what what how did that wait wait okay you're gonna walk through that one. Okay so so I can't imagine like four in the morning like that sounds hellish.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8327,Like the claim video games at night is so much better though it feels incredible like I love doing it I love being awake at night so much there's like not so much like commotion and stuff and like I don't know I can get started.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8338,I mean everything is quiet yeah yeah it's good. I mean sure like it's fun to like be out outside club like smoking a cigarette or something like that two in the morning but like four o'clock playing video games like video games is where it's at
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8351,you're wrong. True. You're chatting now right now we don't need that in here. I play Legends of Rube Terra. The fuck is that the League of Legends card game. What the hell is that the rage? The League of Legends card game.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8368,The League of Legends card game it got it got it got me back in the card games. I fell off Hearthstone like a year ago but it's like it pulled me back in. Wow I need to sell my fucking Hearthstone account such a worth anything I think I have like a
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8380,fuck. No it might have a small comeback because they're bringing back they're making a new class one cafe completely fell off like outside of like a Hearthstone add a team fight tactics type thing to it as well. Yeah they did it's it's more popular than the yeah they have an auto battle it's actually
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8399,pretty good but the issue is they didn't have a they don't have a way to monetize it. They didn't want to like know obviously with them. Come on so now their most popular mechanic has no profit in it.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8409,Can somebody tell me why the fuck auto battlers came back I remember that shit when I was like 14 auto battlers were a really big thing then they died then they came back. Why the fuck they were right now.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8419,We started in Starcraft 1 use maps okay. I'm actually true. I feel like I know of like three games that people have forgotten about and it's like it was at like a billion dollar company can I go make fucking bunker wars or something like that
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8433,or marina arena and you know the next big genre of fucking game is we need to be goddamn tower defense games those things are so. Oh yeah I completely agree. 100 percent. Wait you just hold on. The. Good.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8447,No go on. Go on. Okay so you wait you really like tower defense. You all like tower defense. Yeah. Yeah. Tower defense is mostly tower defense because of the hero that should just fucking baller building mazes for enemies to run through is your buildings fucking kill
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8461,them upgrading your shit hell yeah. Dude I feel like I'm getting so old I mean I was I was like I was you know obviously alive during the blue tower defense fucking blow up thing that like blew up like 10 years
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8474,ago and now here I am listening to a bunch of people talking about how they want to play tower defense games. Well there's some good ones for Starcraft 2. Good gem tower defense. That was a pretty good one.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8483,When I played those I played the Dota ones like I played all of those tower defense games. I was huge into tower defense and then I just got bored. Another thing that's going to blow up is surfing. Like that's that could probably have its own game I think at this point.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8497,Enough people. Surfing that and yeah like surfing like surfing is like always been there on this side but nobody really cares how much about it. It's just people play between Qs I think. Wait surfing like oh like CS go I think like surfing on the water.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8510,I was like wait what we got counter-truig surfing and then I mean jump maps a certain extent. That type of shit might have something but yeah. I think the reason Auto Paler became really popular was it was just like it was a good it
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8523,was a slightly intelligent game aim that you could play on your phone. So it was easier and faster than a card game but still like functional and that's the strategy on your phone. Yeah but I mean it blew up primarily on the computer recently right.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8539,Like it blew up a lot because of Dota Auto Chest right that was the big thing that kicked it off right. For a lot of people was Dota Auto Chest and then it went to. It's Auto Chest. Auto Chest was the first one of those that came out right was it.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8552,Yeah I think it was the Dota mod Auto Chest was the one and then it followed up with that. I think was Underlords and then shortly after was TFT and then how like I see Dan and like Mutton still playing TFT.
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8564,Steven do you still play TFT? Fuck no. Yeah I was going to say like I'm like. Yeah you know what I'm saying about fucking TFT that's me but like I don't know I mean Dan is still in it you still having fun with that?
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8575,TFT um yeah a new season came out I play it like intermittently in between Todd or Rust or things like that but uh I don't know I don't know how much the replayability is there and I don't know if I want to fucking grind all the way to like diamond or something like that
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8588,it's kind of I don't know that's a little annoying. Dude I have a really big like problem where I like want to play these ranked games and I'm thinking I'm going to be great I just got to put some time in it I realize how much time I got to put
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8600,into it and how much like fucking how shit I am at like aim and stuff and like like for instance like league and shit like I oh my god dude I have the worst hands in the world I have the slowest hands because I played Dota 2 before I played League I was real fucking good
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8613,at Dota but I fucking suck at League because I play for some reason I decided to play all of the hook uh supports so like I have to like land shit really well and my my hands will just literally
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8624,like oh by now on my fucking mouse I'll just throw my arm one direction for some reason I'm just gonna muscle spasm it's fucking weird I don't know why I do it to myself then scrunge stop talking about League you're making me want to play chill we did a listen dude a chat's gonna
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8638,hate me I'm gonna that's what I'm gonna keep talking about it by my way a listen dude oh god I came back to league with the shutdown and such a few days ago when I rose I haven't played
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8650,in years I'm because I used to play jungle I'm like what is going on I have no idea I'm just going back to playing card games yeah it's a good choice what's up my words animal crossing 2 o i q's and sage game or master race
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8666,I don't know I've got so much shit scheduled okay listen I just like the listening background and jump on when you make me mad the thing is is that when I go on podcast nobody fucking says anything and then I just sit there for like an hour because everybody's too scared
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8678,and then I nothing happens and it's like god I'm so fucking bored dude if we're pretty true actually wait hold on if we're being straight like what you could talk about is your lobbying take I've had so many streamers coming to my stream to say talking shit about your lobbying take saying
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8694,that you don't know what the fuck you're talking about when it comes to the super goes against like most conventional wisdom and it goes against everything I thought I don't know that's something that I need to spend like two or three days of stream just rooting about yeah I had so many studies
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8703,thrown at me that are like but like the biggest problem that I have reconciling and like a lot of people just hate it when I say this and the biggest problem I have reconciling is there was a quote that I read and it's like for what a high stakes game politics is there's a surprisingly
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8714,little amount of money that's actually spent on it yeah and when I look at that and when I look at how much money Steyer spent and look at how much money Bloomberg spent and I look at how much money
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8723,Biden spent in some states I don't know like the whole like money corrupting all of politics or whatever how like relatively ineffective super PACs event at swaying people's opinions from one city I I'm not sure I mean I have to that's that's gonna be like a thing yeah so this is my
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8740,department do you do you want my do you know here we go do you want me on do you want me to mention lobbying or money in politics are you familiar with my like the recent kind of take
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8752,whatever that I have I look man I think you're I think you're really interesting really intelligent I I think I catar stream maybe twice a week yeah no no no no that's fine I don't expect anybody to watch my street I was just curious that I don't know what I'm gonna repeat it stuff basically
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8765,my prior positions is that I used to think that money in politics is basically what made political opinions happen it controlled what politicians wanted it controlled what people wanted um you know a lot of manufacturing consent that companies choose what we want to be motivated in they
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8777,manipulate the public opinion through lobbying and advertising and etc etc etc that that notion has been like pretty radically challenged over the past couple of weeks based on things that I've read and then based on what's happened in the primary season
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8791,where the alternative opinion that I'm being presented right now is that yeah money pulses have some effect but in reality politicians generally just tend to vote with their constituents and lobbying groups just tend to support politicians that would support those positions anyway
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8804,the NRA doesn't actually go and flip senators or flip congressmen or get legislation passed that wouldn't be supported by senators or congressmen anyway but rather they just find people that already support those positions and then they provide money to those people um to help them
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8816,make better cases to their constituents and to congress more or less that's like the pretty big radical shift that I've had like lately in terms of like looking at lobbying and money in politics in general so that's that's right it's there's a little bit more complications to that
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8830,than just that but so the classic thing you're correct if you're the if you're the oil lobbyist you're not going to spend a lot of time giving money to AOC because she's going to keep just shredding the tracks in your face and go away however like if you do and further if you're an oil
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8844,lobbyist you probably spend your time talking to representatives who have a lot of oil workers or oil interests in their district whether that be the stuff a major oil company or labor lobbies or people that have like a lot of jobs there stuff like that yeah wait let's let's let's take this
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8861,out of time okay so you can so that's the first thing like you just got focus on those people which we understood though is if you're calm if you're let's just keep simple if you're if you're congressman harken harken and i'm an oil lobbyist i give you uh four million dollars
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8875,and all my friends give you four million though so you got like a million dollars from oil lobby if you're a good congressman who knows what you're they're doing you really don't need to spend that much money gain reelected once you've been incumbent and you've won a few rounds a couple
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8887,times what you use that money for as congressman harken you can go and say hey congressman destiny didn't support my it could be something completely off brand to destiny congressmen destiny didn't support my uh lgbtq a rights bill i'm going to give some of this oil money which is now just my money
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8903,to a challenger of his or a pact that's got support a challenger of his it's it's the money money is power and but you're certain companies who will support their allies or feel support will give power to them to them which they can then do is as they wish because again like just because i give you
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8919,a million dollars as being you've suspended on supporting my oil interest you can spend that money on hookers and blow or you can spend that money on helping people for other political reasons or help yeah so what's known is like the trial and industries were very cash rich
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8936,in these things that's what gave them a lot of political power if anyone wants to read a book on this and last year enough talk about this the great a great book on this is called the prize if you're really interested in the history of oil and law politics in america of the world
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8947,but what should be understood is you you focus on your allies and you focus on giving your allies power to get more power for your allies like this is what i say you know the example is this is tech like tech like various tech companies like spectra or once time war cable yes famously
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8963,gives about two thousand dollars every congressperson that promises to vote for them every year but what should be understood is there are a couple congressmen centers they spend a lot of money on because those people are very tied to them for various reasons reasons like they and thus they support
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8977,them directly and give them power and help them support in their projects etc it's more trying to find individual players of power than trying to build a massive 51 percent coalition sure yeah i guess my my view of it before was much more aligned i've never read manufacturing
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,8991,percent i ordered it i'm hoping to read it soon although i'm scared because i don't know how long that book is i hope it's not a massive fucking book but um manufacturing concerns a complicated book yeah but the way that the view is presented to me and that is it basically you'd have a whole
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9004,public that wouldn't be supportive of some policy and politicians that might not be supportive of some policies but via some shady form of like corporate like advertising and ad spend you basically can manufacture opinions that refer from the public through this this weird like interchange
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9020,of like corporations and media and politicians and everything which it's it's it's like the argument that people use when they talk about like the electability of biden was propagated on manufacturing consent that was uh main narrative i think uh throughout that well i mean biden is like the
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9038,current democratic election still needs to be studied but the basic sum total is something told based on pure land speculation what we have and i think seaben i talked we talked about this earlier on but the theory there were two theories were two and there were three theories either
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9052,biden was going to steamroll everyone burdens pop burns popular revolution would take off the steam roll everyone or someone would kind of like split the difference with with both candidates and that kind of moderate wave would take over the theory was if bernie was going to win he'd have to be beat
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9066,biden he didn't beat biden so so biden steamrolled everyone and the reason he did so was because electability really what that means is the party supports this person and thus it's essentially an argument for like the status quo and people want the status quo because they want to return
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9080,to normalcy that isn't the the covid-19 that isn't the economic risk that isn't trump that's what people want i feel like i feel like one thing that it's hard to tell in terms of like what we talked about a lot too is it feels like the sanners campaign like anti-establishment is like a nice
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9096,sentiment for the public but you do need to make these connections whether it's with media or other congressman or reaching out to people like state like congressman and she like it seems like that's probably an important conversation that needed to happen at some point in the campaign
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9109,that just never did because the sanners campaign was horrendous at courting uh... endorsements so i i think the interesting i think no no go on you i've talked about glones um so like i've i hadn't extensive conversations with individuals about like for instance why all of the endorsements
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9126,were going to like biden and stuff like that i think one of those arguments is like because biden has connections to actual people that like they could link up with if you were to endorse biden right yeah i feel like that's a pretty good thing but this is the problem is that like
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9140,people say this like it's a bad thing but do you remember how mad all the progressives got when hillary came out and it was like nobody really likes bernie and everybody's like that's not true fuck you fuck you hillary and it's like well i mean like biden had some hundred senators and
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9156,congressman like endorsing him like in his back pocket bernie like fifteen you know and your ability to make those friendships and connections is maybe it doesn't matter for some things but when it comes to passing legislation whipping votes and having those friends and connections
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9170,is really fucking important like it's super important like imagine you're trying to pass sorry just for let me just touch it i'll go on go on one last moment like imagine you're trying to pass legislation and we're like relying on somebody saying like hey can i rely on your vote
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9184,and knowing that you can rely on that person's vote like instinctively and that you have this like long deep connection that you can draw on with this individual that they'll vote on this vote on that right though they'll have your best interests in mind stuff like that having those connections i
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9198,mean you're talking about like friendships in professional relationships as well inside of in like congress in the senate that are like really important like i don't know like yeah it's a really big fucker with the senate's campaign yeah i think that as well but i'm sorry go ahead
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9214,so just so i can say it's unbiased in case on type centrap i worked for bernie in 2015 i don't work in form currently nor did i work for him on this current election and further like i don't
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9224,like being the solution i'm trying to steal man the bernie defense squad but i feel like it's valuable for this discussion so i'll try to do it anyway for this assembly trying to argue political strategy i think bernie like if we examine of that as like the the high point of the bernie
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9237,campaign the organizational abilities their goal is like an anti-sasquo campaign campaign was not to let they didn't need to spend a ton of energy getting the endorsement of like harry reed what they need to do is make it clear to harry reed encourage him to doubt his ability to like win the
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9253,majority or the in the state if he can endorse anyone so nobody that carried me to endorse till after the nevada caucus notably the union to endorse that's in the nevada caucus now if we're going to play like you could say that was because of online harassment but fuck what
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9268,garris if it's online harassment or just a demonstration of political power and will you need to do that like that if you're going to an anti-establishment campaign you can't give room for people to feel politically comfortable with the stat with the people you're running against
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9281,to endorse them you need to make them doubt the strength of their opponents you need to make them fearful you need to damage them's complete total control but like i heard that like when it came to like getting the attorney's attorney's attorney's attorney's attorney's attorney's attorney's
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9292,like i don't know about harry reed but like i know that cliburne was supposed to be a very very very important endorsement important endorsement in south carolina and supposedly the sanners campaign like never even reached out to him is what i was reading like yeah that was weird well so the practical
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9304,reality is it would be very difficult because of the party infrastructures for the sanners campaign to get any endorsements down in the american south like that however there which clears their goal should have been more to organize in a certain way and to talk cliburne a certain way
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9319,to encourage them not to endorse biden yeah get onto a spy biden that would have been their victory point that was that like so here essentially the sum up down like the burning campaign on delegation on uh on um endorsements their goal was to win with steel mates and try a win with the
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9335,populist out turn or whatever because that would give them enough that would essentially challenge biden and give them enough room to win they failed to do that now i think it's either they had two options either they could try to become like say like no look i'm i'm a better coalition builder
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9352,than but then burn then biden like i'm pro-gun i'm i'm this i have a better i have a better field of hispanics i can do all this kind of this like these new deal stuff like that would have been a
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9362,way kind of demonstrated this sort of like i'm almost uh it's from the burning campaign like i'm a better appealing to moderate voters than then biden like i that's where i think the independent line will have worked with them they didn't do that for on the other hand though if you
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9378,like this is where you go full pop like full radical populace this is like you need to attack people you need to go sit you need to walk into the room and say i'm going to murder everyone in
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9386,this room that they vote for me and like that's what trump did he said jeb bush like you remember that those republican debates like he was just calling out republican royalty he insulted the bush family to their face who are like politically powerful in this country and unless like unless
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9402,like unless burning sandals is gonna say biden is an old man who has no he's doing who supports irrigationists to his face on a lot of television mission he was never going to beat biden like that's it like i imagine if bernie was 20 years younger and willing to say hey biden you're
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9419,like like do you remember when julian castro insulted by biden well one more Harrison's that's well early debates when one julian castro or kamala Harris attacked biden i know when kamala harris and him disagreed with the busing thing yeah well yeah well do you remember that was
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9433,the height of kamala Harris's polling yeah one hundred percent of your second you need to attack and bernie and kybom was a weirdly like i don't attack people i attack institutions or whatever his theory was i mean i think part of it from everything i remember that's that's a bernie personal
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9448,thing and i imagine based on kind of people his like at least he was like david strode words like they were really willing to go on the attack but bernie didn't want to if they went on the attack
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9458,i don't know maybe they would have turned a lot people off but the reality is like you need to look the air person in the face and say i think they're evil monsters i will burn this party to the ground like same way like if bernie wants to get single player health care he needs to be
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9472,able to go to biden by himself and look him in the eye and say i will run third party sure like if that's it like we can't wait this is wait real quick my nose are you here my nice do you want
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9483,to debate pixie tonight oh yep you're doing it all right go ahead dakkwini okay so like it this is political power if you could you need to like what allows the moderate will allow quote moderates to be politically powerful is they can always go to someone say
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9500,give us what we want all the other side or we'll we'll cause you to lose and that's what you need if that and that's what's the failure of the left of america they need to be one to say
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9509,give us what we want or we'll cause you to lose haven't they kind of said that though don't we have like a lot of at least online don't we get that kind of yeah the burn your eyeliners online 90% of those people don't matter like do you think anyone outside of
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9521,the t-bridge witch knows who any piece of it no but i mean like i feel like pretty i feel like it was pretty common that bernie wouldn't even consider like non-viable like people would ask him constantly like oh would you be the vice president blah blah he would constantly say like oh you know i'm running
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9533,to win like in a discussion like i thought that was generally yeah but yeah but no no no like uh from my perspective of the major like quote left wing media people who can get on cable news i think the most noble one is sam cedar and that's still one of note if you're if you're the
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9551,producer on ooster at cnn or with mbc sam cia is the only voice you know on the of the internet stuff maybe you know maybe your kid watches xqc or something and that's about it like you don't know these people like that is the reality of alternative like so further like dear like
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9567,there's i'm sure there's a generic like oh online people are harassing us in our twitter mentions but like no one knows who 90% of these of these blue check mark youtube twitch lefties are like they inlet like what's scared a lot of people like if you like if you remember way back
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9585,in 2016 do you remember that moment outside of the democrat convention where there were a bunch of sirens people talking about how nate silver said that bernie had a very chance of winning based on poling or whatever like that that scared the democratic party shitless because they had numbers
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9601,and they were in front of cameras their fuel protesting in front of the democratic convention and they had like they were quote well because it's a demonstration of political power the reality is if you're of if you consider like here's my hot tick and here's a hot tick you can hit every
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9615,online lefty with if you're trying to have a debate with them ask if they've ever left their room to do more than to do canvas because something really disappointed me i was talking to a few people who actually came out to a bernie canvas that a friend helped me want my help organizing
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9630,and i'll say i helped i attended one bernie canvas they were a bunch of people who had youtube shows and podcasts and even like a twitch person you guys are going to be a twitch person and every single one of them said this is their first time canvassing and that's a kind of demonstration
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9648,of it now i'm not saying these people are lying or whatever but it is accurate that some of them do need to leave that leave their apartments a little more often just to demonstrate their ability to organize true why do that when you get up spicy twitter takes well yeah well because
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9667,politics is hard hard true are you ready mind waves yeah bring it on this is an easy argument okay do we have any closing thoughts from anybody from dog irrelevant or whatever mind weight i was and uh picks here gonna have a debate on states or something i don't know how i want to see

D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9861,holy shit that was so good holy shit you climbed that holy shit my meals haven't changed at all honestly your views on what i've been changing at all oh no uh we're talking about how we've been needing during the crisis oh i have been tapping into my pasta and various flavors side
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9884,what's up pixie hi oh it is time all right listen up pixie and mind waves are going to be having a conversation i am going to be moderating the two of you okay um i will only step in if i feel like
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9905,you guys are talking past each other or misrepresenting each other's points but otherwise you two are just fucking ready to fucking go ham okay good luck all right pixie um where do rights come from well let's start with our original claim right um so let me that's why i've been like trying to
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9927,pull off for the ten minutes but my computer is being a little bit um but the claim is basically rights are non-existent if a state is not there like to protect it let me find it i'm not sure if
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9941,that was the exact statement okay yeah so we could pull up the exact tweet if you want or i can try to like reiterate what i actually meant in that tweet if you want it's up to you maybe we end up
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9956,just like agreeing with each other if we agree with the first premise so it's human rights don't exist without a state to enforce them don't at me so what do you need by that exactly or what do you
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9968,mean because like you responded i responded with like rights can basically exist with or without a state um the state has historically violated rights and then you responded with rights are what was your exact response again like let's find it um so if you acknowledge that there's a state
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,9985,then you acknowledge that like it must be there something i forgot what exactly you said no it's so what i said in reply to that as i quote tweeted you saying if we agree rights are socially constructed then we must agree that a state is necessary to protect them unless you make some
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10000,nonsense claim that human rights are god-given or found naturally in the universe um which if i was going to be more precise in my language i would have said that it's not necessarily the state but more so governance right and i don't think that there is
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10019,a form of governance that is adequate to protect states or protect rights other than a state i i don't i don't agree with this idea of like anarchist communal policing or governance as being adequate enough to like protect somebody's rights it's just a fantasy right oh hey i don't even think
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10037,there's a debate here because what my argument was that like yeah rights are social constructs but they will exist without a state but then you can make the argument that oh the state is the best way to protect them or not but that's a separate argument i don't even think i disagree
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10052,with you on so i don't think that's a thing so what what what what useful or like what utility does the the statement like my right exist if you can't enforce it or or um enact them well because then
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10064,it comes to the whole idea that even if okay i'm trying to think well i can probably explain it if you make the statement that rights only exist because of a state or that their existence comes back to like the state existing then i can see like an argument in favor of making the claim like oh
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10085,you know there's no need to challenge like let's say China for violating human rights or that human rights technically can't be violated if the state doesn't acknowledge them to begin with um well yeah you can't violate you can't violate a human's rights if they had no rights in the first
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10101,place right well that's idea a human rights right the whole idea is that we believe people should be entitled to this or that they're entitled to that um should be independent of whether the state mandates it or not so let's take civil rights for example um we can argue that old people are
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10123,entitled to vote it's a right to vote um just because the state didn't allow black people to vote doesn't mean that those people should not have those rights or that those rights are or should be non-existent to those people they are i think we have to separate like um descriptive claims from
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10142,like ought claims right like i i think that it's one thing to say that whether or not somebody has a right it's another thing to say whether or not they should have a right and i i don't think that
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10152,you can make an appeal to having a right if this if you don't have a form of governance or like in my example a state to to recognize that right can you keep that claim one more time okay so the statement of like like a right existing doesn't really matter to me right like at the
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10172,end of the day the only thing that matters is how you're able to enact them or enforce them right so like uh like a black a black person saying that like i have rights back when slavery before it was abolished right didn't really mean anything but like we could have a conversation of
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10187,should black people have rights why they want to just to clarify here so i don't think pixie is saying that black people needed to make the arguments that they should have rights but rather that they did have rights and those rights weren't being respected i think maybe you guys should
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10201,define what you guys mean by rights maybe that's where the difference of agreement is well exactly because if you say that like they are if you say somebody has a right where does that right come from if not from whatever governance that we're talking about well it comes from the social
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10214,construct right right so it comes from the social construct society as a whole or sections of society acknowledge that human beings are entitled to a or b or c thing and as long as we recognize that those people are entitled to that that's independent of whether the governance allows it or not
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10236,but in my opinion social constructs are completely meaningless if not like if you don't have a way to like protect them uh or or like it sounds like so it sounds like there's not really a disagreement here then what you what you essentially saying is that you may or may not have rights but the
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10252,enforcement of the rights is what matters not the existence of the rights themselves because pixie saying that you have rights regardless of a state existing or not and you're not really concerned with the existence of said rights you're not you're not uh contesting that you're saying that the
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10264,right itself is not relevant without an enforcement mechanism which is a fundamentally different claim right uh yeah well exactly because like the the statement in and of itself i have a right like to blank doesn't really like there's no utility in that argument in and of itself
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10283,well i'm not exactly sure about that because when somebody says like i have a right to vote and that's being violated by the state it doesn't like what it it basically like has a social implication to it that you got a fight for your right or that you know that the state is like
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10301,violating your right not that the state has to like you know be benevolent and grant you that right the social connotation is that like more serious than that that the state is not being benevolent benevolent if they give you that right it's your right it's yours and you should take it if you can
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10316,like it's i guess like maybe it's just like a sementical argument but the implications are strongly like two different things with how we interact with our government and whether we use to go through like proper channels or through um mass protest or boy codding or things like that
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10335,to be able to ascertain that right okay so so you're saying that like um basically there is utility in saying i have a right because then that gives you the platform which to advocate for the right to recognize them um more or less i'm not sure if i'm being exactly clear with it
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10357,but historically speaking and this is just like i also like a matter of like semantics and like appealing to emotion when it comes to social movements but there is a very big different statement at least like emotionally speaking or how you listen to it or how it resonates with
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10372,people if you say oh you know the state should grant me like sure but then we're not talking about whether or not a right exists we're talking about effective rhetoric to like get rights enacted or recognized by the state well yeah because the the conversation kind of shifted to what's effective
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10390,of saying oh i have a right or well let's let's move what we're not talking rhetoric so let's move back to the principal question so for mind waves so for pixie do you think that you have you rights exist regardless of the existence of a state to protect said rights yes okay mindwaves do you
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10407,agree that rights exist regardless of a state that exists to defend those rights or do you think they become not exist no absolutely not okay so then the question is where do you think rights come from this would be like where your disagreement would be i mean but we both agree they come from social
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10424,constructs well i know i think i think i don't think you agree with that pixie um so for instance like when you said earlier about blacks wanting to not be enslaved i mean technically socially constructed at the time by the majority was it will blacks ought to be enslaved right oh okay
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10441,unless you make something different by that go um do things i guess if we're i this is gonna i think go back to philosophy right because if i'm making the argument i'm i'm maybe i'm not like very sure
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10455,about how i feel about the statement um but i would argue that cubans would have some innate right to freedom or should because wait wait when you say innate what do you mean by that innate how like by
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10470,virtue of being human by virtue of god what by virtue of being human um but we already know that's not true because like the way that we conceive of uh rights differs from culture to culture historically uh and and even can't be contemporarily i didn't finish my argument um the reason why i
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10491,was going to argue that humans should have an innate right um for let's say something like freedom would go back to like this whole philosophical argument that in order to live in a best and most profit and prosperous society for everybody then human being should be allowed to be free well this
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10510,is a uh i don't know how you can say people should have an innate right it is either innate or it is not right well i guess yeah so i would just say okay so you're saying that people should have rights
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10525,that they don't have it inherently that it doesn't come from their humanity right i don't i'm not sure if i'm explaining myself clearly so i think you should have well here's the way the question is where do you pick pixie where do you think rights come from it's the question and what was i was
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10543,what i was arguing before is that i do think that they are social constructs um so yeah i think that socially constructed like rights as a whole the reason like just like gender or just like even race up to its own extent these are constructs that we created however just because their social
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10561,constructs doesn't make it any less real necessarily so just because we socially like true have this concept of like you know people should be free doesn't make it any less what about when rights are socially constructed away from people i guess i don't know if that makes sense but like so if the
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10578,majority of society believes that a minority of society should have some rights stripped from it where would they get their rights from um where would the minority get their rights from yeah let's say majority want to do a press a minority um well that's why i was like trying to kind of like go
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10595,back with the whole idea of like maybe some rights are innate and some aren't um because rights is a very fake word there's a lot of things that we could put under rights well we would argue that the only the only right that you have innate to you by from the moment you're
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10610,born to the moment you die is you're right to kill yourself like that that is the only one that you can fundamentally exercise without any sort of third party protecting it or without having to enter into like some sort of social contract well where do you think rights come from then mind
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10624,ways i i think that we uh we i think that we um basically yeah we we can socially construct them and enact them through governance so you don't think that innately you don't think that any person has any right that those rights are only delegated by a state yeah absolutely okay wait then
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10648,if sounded like earlier you guys didn't have those that difference of opinion so then so then mind ways you would argue that like a person that exists um outside of a country innately has no rights granted to it um i'm sorry run that by me again so a person that exists outside of some
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10668,state that person has no rights innately unless that state recognizes the the rights of that person no absolutely not okay let's so hypothetically let's only get this at a moral level now i come across a person in a forest that is outside the the borders of any government should i morally be
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10685,allowed to kill that person because i don't think they innately have any rights because they don't belong to a state well i think that when we're talking about morality and rights it's very important to separate the two i think that i think that i think that of ethics or something right
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10700,like it would have to be like any conversation well i think that we base our rights off of what we perceive to be moral i i don't think that rights are inherently or rights are moral by virtue of
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10710,being a right like um well what do you okay so then here's a question what do you guys both think rights are maybe we should have did that definition well that's why i was trying to say i think rights
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10720,are what we believe people should be entitled to what do you think rights i think are i think are right is what we recognize to be a right uh through governance like basically whatever humans are entitled to under a form of governance okay well i mean like in that case then you've kind
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10739,of like defined like like through the definition you you must be correct mindwaves right if by definition you're saying a right is something that is recognized by the government then of course your rights can ever exist without a government right so you guys would have to reconcile your
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10752,differences and definitions of what rights are but that this might just be semantic like you mindwaves you might say i don't think people have rights outside of a government but we still have some moral obligation to treat them in a certain way in which case i imagine pixie would
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10767,probably agree you guys would just be using different words to describe similar things right that would i guess i'll pick up yeah so i'm not sure how we could necessarily reconcile that difference because i i feel like pixie's trying to like um think of rights as something that's like
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10782,that comes from just your humanity and i i just don't know if you could like point me towards that or anything like yeah so the thing is is that like it sounds like both of you are using different
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10790,words to describe the same ideas so you you share ideas so it sounds like if i were to ask both of you if you find a stateless person wandering in the forest should you be able to murder that person
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10799,both of you would say no pixie would say it's because that person has rights you would say it's because that person is like worthy of moral consideration so you would be describing a similar concept but you'd be using a different vocabulary to describe it sort of sounds like to me right i
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10814,would make an appeal to him towards morality to not murder that person i wouldn't say that that person necessarily has a right if it's not being if if like uh if that right isn't guaranteed by some sort of form of governance i mean i isn't the whole idea of rights that them and themselves
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10829,are kind of like an appeal to morality a reason but like even though absolutely not i i view rights as in a uh rights to me are strictly utilitarian based um i i find utility in granting humans rights
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10843,i don't think that it has anything to do with morality i think yeah but it seems like the problem then is that pixie statement pixie sounds like somebody that is regarding morality that when pixie says i think that people have rights irrespective of any government recognizing them for you to step
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10858,in and say well no they don't essentially makes it sound like you're saying we could just kill people that are stateless because they have no morality unless you unless you're very clear about the difference in vernacular that's going on here well we we can but should we or should we not as if we
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10870,want to say we can like you should you ought to be able to without it being like a moral crime or something well i i i don't view crime as being like is legal or illegal as a moral crime is i'm
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10882,sorry when i say a moral crime i mean i mean like something would be morally atrocious or morally not good okay um yeah so i would say murdering people is immoral whether or not that person has rights guaranteed to them yeah sure and that immorality of murdering them is i i'm guessing
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10900,what pixie would say well that is what i consider a right so we agree with it we just you agree that you're just using different words to describe the same thing what it sounds like i would i would argue that pixie should rather make an appeal towards morality instead of like rights
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10913,because i i don't know where this is this is where we disagree on again right right um my whole idea is that rights are interlinked with morality so by making a appeal to rights they are making an appeal to morality so do you think that so do you think that rights define morality or morality
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10939,defines rights which ways which way does that go um usually morality defines rights and and why so pixie i think when she says that what you mean pixie is that like rights would be a subset of morality that you have some moral code and then rights come from said moral code
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10960,absolutely i don't think that they have to though not necessarily i think that i can make the argument for human rights without appealing to any sort of morality right i can say that like um a human's right to privacy uh is good because of the utility that it grants society in general
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10980,by granting them those rights what are you going to do without having this what is good man huh um watch out what i can well i would i would say through a utilitarian framework uh which are utilitarianism is the application of good not the definition of good though right
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,10997,utilitarianism is just how we apply the good not what the good is sure yeah so i i maybe i i guess if you take it down all the way um or if you break it down all the way
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11011,i guess you could say that like the way that we determine rights is by determining what is moral and by the way that we determine what is moral is by determining what is good in society yeah okay yeah i i i don't think that i necessarily disagree with that i don't think that i i
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11033,yeah i don't think that you anybody really could disagree with that well then my question to you would be how come if you if you believe rights are a subsection of morality then morality exists with can exist without a state of course morality can exist without a state absolutely that doesn't
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11055,mean that rights are but if you just like said that rights are a subsection of morality and they're like a way that we kind of frame morality um sure but like a rectangle is not a square but a square
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11067,is or no is it the other way around i fucking forgot you know what i mean you know what i'm parallelogram or something or what uh like uh like uh like uh i don't know fucking but like like
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11080,just because like i think that rights um just because we i think that we use morality to to determine our rights doesn't mean that i think that morality equals rights yeah but the whole idea is morality is independence of a state or not right or am i wrong yeah absolutely so if morality
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11099,is independence of a state and the way that we ascertain rights is as a subsection of morality we it's basically a short or it's basically where we derive our rights from then why would it why would its mere existence depend on a state um because i don't think that your claim to have a right
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11120,means anything if you're not able to enforce it but that's a that's a different argument your argument would then be like practicality not the mere existence of the right right i don't know what does it mean for a right to exist what do you mean by that it's a good question
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11139,well that's where we go back to like appeals for morality um or where you are going back to like utah thirian framework it just means it's kind of like a should statement like people should be entitled to x or y um well okay so again you can't say that it exists you can make a
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11156,claim that it should exist right that was the my that that was the whole thing that was like kind of like driving me crazy with your argument is that you you're making this claim that they can't exist uh instead of that they should exist i i you're totally within your right i think it's
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11170,totally reasonable to say that you know this right should exist we should recognize this right what when you say should exist i think you guys are talking about the existence of two different things i think she's talking about the existence of the innate like moral consideration a person
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11185,should have and you're talking about the existence of the enforcement of said in a moral consideration the versions should have it sounds like you're talking about the existence of two separate things does that that make sense or do you want me to explain in different words yeah if you could yeah
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11200,so like she's arguing that rights exist you're arguing that the application of said rights are like that your contention her contention is whether or not the rights exist your contention is whether or not the application of the defense of the rights exists so she says i say that rights exist without
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11217,a state and then you say well i don't think rights exist without a state she's talking about whether or not rights exist you're talking about whether or not the application of those rights exist so she might say you have a right to be not enslaved and and she'd say well that exists even without a state
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11230,and you'd say well i think that doesn't exist without a state because the state needs to prevent you from being enslaved but you guys are talking about the existence of two separate things she's talking about rights you're talking about an enforcement action does that make sense sorry
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11242,i i just don't see how you like um what meaning or what utility does the statement of my right exists or this right exists have if you're not able to enforce it well right this is this is where
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11260,i had two arguments one um it's in terms of like rhetoric this is where like the rhetoric um argument came from it's a lot more powerful and it's a lot more influential to say i have a right to vote that is being violated than to say i should be granted voting rights there like one is just
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11283,rhetoric like just speaking pure rhetoric has a much more like emotional impact and then the second one is that the statement that your rights come from a state again kind of ask for a benevolent state if that makes any sense so right so it sounds like more it sounds like more like you're
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11301,requesting rights instead of saying that they exist i would argue that they don't exist until you're able to enact them or or until you're able to um also uh apply them right i think i'm more so in terms of what she's trying what she's saying like a more charitable way would be
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11316,um like i think in pixies world i think the question she would ask is how can you demand a state respect your rights if you don't believe you have any rights to be respected without the state already respecting said rights right so like let's say i i want to be not enslaved well why you
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11330,don't have that right because the state hasn't given it to you well you're kind of in a conundrum right like by what by what measure can you demand the respect of a right if you believe the right doesn't
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11339,exist until it's already respected it's the question so how could you advocate for gaining rights that you don't already have yeah so a black person without appealing without appealing to that right yeah being granted by the state a black person says i don't want to be enslaved and you
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11353,say well your rights come from the state and the state's currently enslaving you so get bent like what's the argument against that by what right can that person respect a right to be respected when they don't exist because the state is yeah so i i think that you they're like you can make several
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11368,different arguments for the reason why a right should exist even if it doesn't isn't already recognized by a state you could say that like when it comes to slavery for instance that um you know having a a underclass of of human beings exist is is bad for society for x and y reason
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11386,you can lay out the economic impact of of not granting rights to people um the um social like the the sort of like social consequences of not granting certain subsets of humans uh rights and stuff like that you can make those appeals without saying that like i already have
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11404,this right you just haven't recognized it i have a question that kind of confused me you just said rights should exist even if the state doesn't grant it but then that's pixie's argument right like yeah by virtue like your right wouldn't exist if the state doesn't grant it like do you
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11424,understand what i'm saying so you're saying there's these different appeals you can do but none of them would be advocating for your right they just would be like generally advocating why something shouldn't happen or should happen which if you're going to argue why something should or shouldn't
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11442,happen because of the moral effects thereafter you might as well just be talking about rights because that's a moral subsection i feel like this is just like a linguistic like difference though isn't it this is just like a
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11465,like well it is a linguistic difference but i feel like it's an important difference because it kind of shapes how we advocate for ourselves in society so the right for health care um the right for being free the right for being able to practice your religion if we decide that
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11489,rights are given to us by the state and granted to us by the state then we like linguistically it wouldn't make sense to argue for our rights because they would be non-existent period so when somebody's like we should have or we should have the right for what um for health care
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11511,in america then your argument would kind of resort to we do not have a right for health care in america do they doesn't make logical sense to argue for a right for health care in america because the state hasn't granted us that
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11529,do i think that well that's the thing is that like do i think that we have a right to health care right now absolutely not the state doesn't recognize it right but we could make an argument that humans
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11540,should have a right to health care right which is what we're doing right now well that's what rights are what people should be entitled to sure but again i i wouldn't say that that right exist until we write it into legislation right or that we currently do not have that right well
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11560,that's all i idea we currently do not have that right but it's still our right does that make sense i feel like that sounds no it doesn't it doesn't make it sense at all okay by currently for it's okay let's take a person who's in slavery they have the right to be free
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11575,but at that moment they are not free so we have a right to health care but currently we are not be that right is being violated wait wait if you if you make a claim that that right to health
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11589,care exists where could you point it out to me please but it would go back to moral obligation people should be entitled to medical services where does my where does where does the state's moral obligation to recognize the the average citizens uh like like right to health care like
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11609,where does that exist well that's an argument it's not dependent on whether the state wants to grant it to you or not it's dependent on the social construct that we have so society speaking acknowledges that we should do whatever can help us thrive or whatever can help us survive or
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11627,create a better society and humans right should or in order to create like a better world you can even take this from either a utilitarian or county and standpoint either way you're going to arrive that the best thing for humanity in general would be to have health care those are moral
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11646,obligations or moral things separate from the existence of a state or not but then again that this is my whole argument is that your rights aren't our separate like uh rights the concept of rights is is something completely separate to the concept of morality i would say that we oftentimes
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11668,base what is or is not a right or what should or should not be a right off of what we perceive to be morality right how are they completely separate one you you do arrive rights for morality then
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11679,sure but like like what we consider to be moral isn't always what like necessarily what is a right um that's true but it doesn't mean that there are a lot of moral there are a lot of moral or
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11697,immoral actions in society uh that we that we don't really cover with uh that are not granted rights for instance right but it doesn't change the fact that rights are derived from morals you're right in saying that they're not the same thing but if morality exists without the state sure it makes
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11715,logical sense for so if we think that health care like if we think that the uh human right to health care is is a moral ought that we ought to do that because it's moral then i would say that we need
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11727,to write that into legislation have some form of governance like a state recognize that right that would be the argument and then it becomes a right then you have the right then you could say my right exists so here's a question to challenge uh mine ways definition of right if that's a
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11742,right can you tell me what is a meaningful difference between a right and a law or are these two things the exact same thing are all laws rights and are all rights laws um that's a good question um
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11755,um so fuck i actually don't even know like i would have to look at the definition so like um no not necessarily so right because um laws are oftentimes well rights are prohibitive prohibitive too right so i think i think that laws are what we base are um well actually fucking
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11787,no i i have no idea what would you say fixing um i would say that the difference between law and rights is that since rights are what people should be entitled to and like laws are more of a system
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11801,of governance so a system of governments doesn't necessarily cover what people should be entitled to um all the time it's more like a playbook if anything else right so i i would say that um i i would say that rights are kind of the
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11825,the principles in which we base our laws off of right we we try to make sure that the laws that we write um protect the rights that are granted to people already basically we we we right that doesn't make much sense because laws have adapted and changed to ad rights or to like ad rights
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11847,that we've already acknowledged that we should have that we're entitled to to run that by me again so you're saying like we we are entitled to certain rights like we are entitled to the right of not being enslaved laws have adapted to include these rights um or to
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11875,acknowledge them but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't have had the right or the right was or that we shouldn't have had the right before the state acknowledged it right i i feel like um there's only like i feel like rights are kind of a subset of laws right
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11893,like i i feel like um our rights a subset of laws or laws a subset of rights does morality come from laws or does laws come do laws come from morality well laws have to be in in uh laws have to obey what we have already or like uh
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11916,we we have already like laws basically have to um fall in line with what we what rights we have already given the people right so we can't like we can't have a we can't have the right to not be enslaved but then have laws that go against that right sure so here's a question
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11934,do you believe that there are any unjust laws or do you believe that all laws are just no absolutely not because even then like governance isn't perfect oftentimes laws do violate people's rights so if a law violates somebody's rights it seems as though the right
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11951,supersedes the law meaning that the right would have to come before the law no yeah absolutely well if a right comes before law what is a law except the application of force by a state how can a state grant a right or how can a right come from something besides an individual
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11968,if a law can exist out or if a right can exist outside of a law would be the question what do you mean by like so right now you're telling me that a right can supersede a law which a law is is generally the application of force by a state right a law is a
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,11997,state saying this is what should be pixies original argument was that rights can exist independent of any type of state and it seems as though now you're saying well rights can exist that supersede laws but if a law is a decree by the state and a right can exist that supersedes
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12014,that decree by the state then where does the right come from if not from someplace that's not a state that's the question does that make sense so is this argument kind of like um so it would be that like because the state can choose whether or not to recognize those rights
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12035,or that can um can violate those rights that like well no no i'm sorry i'm not i'm not putting forth an argument i'm just introducing you to a contradiction of what you've said you earlier it seems as though you've made the statement that rights come from the state if a right comes from
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12050,the state and a law is what rights are but then i ask you if there's an unjust law is that possible and you say well yeah some laws could be unjust well if rights come from the state and the state is
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12061,telling you that you don't have this right because of a law but you say that some laws are unjust then it seems as though we have a contradiction it seems like your your rights must be coming from someplace besides the state if a state can be incorrect in in dishing out rights by having an
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12074,unjust law so it seems to say that you either have to say well there are no are there are no unjust laws because the state determines your rights so every law is by definition just um or you have to
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12084,say well okay rights don't come from a state because a state might not give you a right that you're entitled to or you could argue possibly that my definition of the word just is wrong and that you can have that i don't know how you do that i think it has to be one of the other two
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12100,does that make sense i'm speaking a lot if it's if it's not that you're dumb if it doesn't make sense i might just be explaining it poorly no i just um i guess i never considered this like what the the the meaningful distinction is between laws and rights and um well some people don't
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12115,think there's a difference and that's what you that's that could be the center point of this debate is that maybe you really do think well what is right is what is legal um and then you guys have a
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12124,disagreement there i don't think you believe that because that's a pretty hard line to walk obviously because slavery was legal at one point right right right wait can we have a role for this conversation if you're saying that you agree with something you have to say correct instead of right
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12137,okay that makes so much sense yeah i was thinking about it yeah because the challenge then to you would be if you essentially think there's no difference between a right and a law then what's the point of even having a word like right it seems it seems you
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12159,probably don't believe that um that if the government would have passed some law that it could torture people you would disagree with said law you wouldn't say that well you don't have a right to not be tortured right right yeah well correct yes um i don't know i i guess the way that i view rights is that
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12182,rights are things that we have socially constructed together uh we we have conceived them as a society and we look to enact we look to enact those into um okay wait hold on so real quick okay this is
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12195,work getting really into the weeds but when we conceive of rights okay socially the conception of a right is different than the idea that we have rights so the concept right of a right yeah the concept of a right oh we have a word for these things blah blah blah blah that could be
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12213,something that we socially kind of come to an agreement about but the the um the uh intrinsic part of your character that has a right these two things are technically separate things just in case so when we say that rights are socially constructed like our understanding of what a right is
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12228,might be socially constructed but your possession of a right as being an inalienable or intrinsic part of your character that's a separate thing okay just to make sure that sure so we we can we can conceptualize like um we can conceptualize what we should like what rights we should have but i
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12244,would argue that those rights unless actually enacted or or or guaranteed by some form of governance doesn't actually exist so i i don't think that just because we conceptualize something that it that it exists i would say that like the concept of a right like for instance the concept of a right
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12264,to um uh to health care doesn't exist but we can conceptualize it right now well then by way measured sorry good oh sorry but that's not true because you definitely have rights that would exist without a state so for example um let's say right now we just dissolve the state you still
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12284,have a right to freedom without the state existing now you can argue that freedom is not as well protected unless if there was a state in place but the right would still exist well that's the thing is i don't know what you mean by exist because like unless it's able to be enforced somebody else
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12303,doesn't have to necessarily recognize that right right uh like so so like you could say that you you have a right to um freedom but somebody could also claim i have the right to violate your freedom right and without a state to to reconcile that what what meaningful existence of a right is there
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12327,i mean i guess it goes back to this whole idea of you're right like the right i don't say intrinsic but just by virtue of you being free you have the right to freedom and i guess that we are asking like where do you draw the line between um one
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12344,person's rights and another person's rights so real quick just to intrinsic just means that it's like it's an it's a part of you you get it's granted to you by virtue of your existence that's what intrinsic means so like if you're a person you have rights period just by by the property of being a
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12358,person means that you have rights that means yeah um but i i think what you're asking mind was is how do we draw the line between one person's rights and another person's rights without third governing and there's two things to say here um one even without a clear line um without a third
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12378,party enacting that clear line it doesn't mean that the rights themselves do not exist and two maybe this is just like too much of a personal definition but but like in theory your rights would end where another person's rights begin right so you're not a lot of correct and what i'm sure but
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12396,without a third party without a third party to arbitrate that to be able to decide when your rights and and another person's like uh begins like like it's ultimately meaningless then we're then we're all just walking around with different conceptions of rights but it doesn't mean that you're non-existent
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12416,okay but what does it mean for a right to exist then well it means that for a right to exist again it goes back to what people should be what uh what people should be entitled to and we can have different definitions of rights people do well no
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12434,that's i i feel like that's not true though because you you saying that like a right exist if we agree that it should exist is kind of um circular logic it well she's not saying that she's saying that's
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12449,that's technically your definition she's saying that rights exist regardless of whether or not somebody else recognizes the existence of said rights i think yeah it's what i guess i know board people kind of confused because it is it is a social construct um but and beat my
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12470,wait wait wait wait what do you mean when you say it is a social construct what you were mentioning before that the word right comes from just the word right comes from us like as a society society acknowledging that the word right is right like it's a right oh yeah so to be clear i'm so
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12486,sorry this is so pedantic but we can say simultaneously that the concept of rights are socially constructed but the existence of rights themselves are intrinsic and and exist independent of social construction so i'm sorry just to explain this so like as a society we acknowledge oh a right is something
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12505,and then here are a bunch of words for what i think a right is but we could also say that there might be a civilization of toddlers that are all crawling around a forest even if they haven't socially constructed the idea of a right we could still argue that they have rights that are
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12519,intrinsic to them even if they haven't socially constructed it does that make sense yeah okay yes i just want to i don't want to yeah i don't want to pivot too much but i have a question for you because maybe this is where it really comes down to mind waves do you believe in
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12534,such a thing as like objective morality oh hell no absolutely not okay i think that might be where our difference is because i well i don't know how you could argue for objective morality unless you're going to argue that they are discoverable in nature or come from god i think they're discoverable
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12554,by nature i think really point to me where in nature that you can find rights well it's a combination of emotion and logic so all you know we have our feelings for example i'm going to use a more
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12568,the feeling for you hold on i'm sorry i just real quick before we pivot because now we're going to an entirely different conversation which is fine but um whether or not somebody is a moral realist or moral anti-realist if we're going to analyze their statements we have to do it with
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12582,their given system it would be kind of foolish otherwise so for instance if somebody says it's not right to rape children and i go oh well actually i disagree with your statement and you're like wait what the fuck and then you argue for two hours and you're like oh well i just don't believe that like
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12596,right and wrong are real concepts it's like oh well hold on well why would you disagree with my statement without initially asserting that you're using an entirely different moral framework to analyze it so just just as an aside like it's pretty important to agree on establish your moral
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12608,framework before having a conversation i do agree that this is probably going to come down to one of you being a moral realist one of you being an anti-realist but that's an important thing to know beforehand otherwise you're having completely different conversations past each other right
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12620,yeah just okay go ahead um yeah go ahead pixley so the reason why i bring up the whole thing of objective morality or not objective morality is because if you believe there is an objective morality and you believe that morality exists with or without the concept of state then you can also
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12639,believe rights are derived from it and that's independent from state because having a state or not would not affect your view of or it would not affect morality per se but if you're like an anti-realist and you don't think that there's such thing as like objective morality you think
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12656,all morality subjective then you're basically saying that the person in charge of i'm so sorry hold on a second or i'll be back okay did i turn on debug mode am i gonna lose all my achievements what just happened why is this being so weird am i gonna lose all my achievements
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12679,i have to reload i'm i don't know what's happening right now okay auto-scene okay sorry i had a crisis um okay i would i i just so if you think that rights come from our morals and you think that our morals are inherent to us that explains why you think that
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12698,our rights are inherent to us too um all right i'm not sure if inherent is right word but for now since i can't think of anyone better like let's go for it yeah sure right so so you think that like
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12712,we are born with like a or we enter this world with like an objective set of morals and that no no no no i'm sorry let me be clear i believe objective morality exists i don't believe that we're born known these morals i believe that it's something that we discern over time and logic
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12734,and emotion like it's not just something that you know we're automatically born with it's something that we discover so then you would say that these are conceptualized and not necessarily inherent in nature right well until until the until the point that we conceptualize the idea of
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12753,morality or or differing ideas of morality or until the the moment that we conceptualized rights that they didn't actually exist in the universe um i'm not sure how i feel about that statement i'm going to give you an analogy and then you can tell me what you think about it it's like if you're
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12769,born into this world and you don't know what dark matter is it doesn't mean that dark matter doesn't exist it just means that you don't know about it does that make sense sure but then then okay so this is you're pointing towards something that that we know like that that is
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12789,actually part of the universe right i'm saying that like dark matter we we know exist because we can we can crunch the numbers we we can find the um the the discrepancies in our in our whatever i don't know fucking the math or science behind that shit right but like we we can find that in nature
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12807,but like the concept the conceptualization of morality you cannot point towards any sort of like math or or science and say that this objectively exists well we kind of in my it's not a hard science but we kind of can in a sense like we look at basically morality to fight and derives
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12829,from emotion and logic so when a person usually people the vast majority of people unless if you're like a sociopath and that's an exception um are born with emotion and that's from your amygdala in your brain and your emotion gives you things like shame empathy grief etc etc
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12851,um and because we as a human species to survive we we develop this in order to be able to kind like thrive as a society right if everybody was born without i i read i reject that morals come
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12866,from emotion i i think that these are i think that i think that you have to you have to separate the two um because oftentimes what because i think that oftentimes our our emotions lead us to to um our our emotions oftentimes lead us to um to do acts of acts that are immoral that we socially
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12888,like uh acknowledge is being a that's why i said emotion plus logic because so you know you start off with this with this emotion you start off with this i don't know fear for example and then you rationalize it or you think is this rational or not and you dissect it and then from the conclusion
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12907,you get from there you realize oh this is logical but emotions aren't logical at all emotions are are e-logical by nature right by definition i absolutely disagree um emotions are sometimes like a shortcut to logic that's not always perfect but take fear for example if you are in the middle
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12929,of a road and you see a car coming straight at you your first instinct is to jump out of the way to get out um now you can logically think okay why is that the case why did i jump out when i saw
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12941,that car and the end result is because my life was in danger your emotion of fear short-coded that for you so we can say right but like it can also like like while emotions can lead to good to good outcomes when it comes to survivability it can also lead you to do very um
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12959,e-logical things right so like but that's what i'm saying if we're talking about if we're talking about sure but if we're talking about cars for instance right just because i've seen a lot of images of car crashes that are that are really fucking horrible doesn't mean that every time
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12972,i'm on the road i should be fearful of my life because it's probably not very likely that i get in a car crash every single time i'm in a in a fucking car right so like that that like that would
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12982,you that would be you acting e-logical because of your emotions which is like well yeah i'm not disagreeing with that what i'm saying is that emotions can sometimes be a shortcut to logic and morals come from our original which is why i think emotions should be absolutely disregarded
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,12999,is because they can they are very unreliable in in giving you good outcomes well so here's a question for pixie so you're saying that sometimes emotions are reliable and sometimes they're not if you have to appeal to a second system to figure out when they are reliable or aren't reliable
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13013,why not just say that that second system is what you base morality on like if you've got to say that i would appeal to just the the logistics of it like if you can determine that it's logical to grant somebody or to consider like uh like you can make a logical argument for
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13032,for morality without having to appeal to emotions at all and you would and if you do so i feel like you would come out with more consistent results each time no because if you keep asking the why question why is that the case why is that the case why is that the case why oh because it's a
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13048,better meant for humanity why does the betterment of humanity matter oh because it's better for you why should i care about that because it'll go back to because it feels better because you know we should strive for that because everybody's happier it goes back to emotion at the like very
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13068,core that we're all striving or we'll show the reason that i want people to be happy is not because i want it is not because it makes me feel good that everybody else is happy the reason i want to be
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13078,i want everybody to be happy is because i think that i can live in a better society if the overall levels of happiness in society are higher right that that objectively like that objectively leads to a better world for me why why do you want to live in a better society
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13097,because i can experience better outcomes before i die i don't know yeah because you can i can experience better outcomes i'll have better feelings from it like i i will feel better about the world around me or i will you know end up having basically a better emotional output if
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13114,my surroundings are more in tune with each other like it goes back to that good one mind waves fuck off dan you just wanted me to call her a bitch like shut up holy shit dan really i don't know i don't know what he's talking about all right pull up the logs chat
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13136,let's go yeah go look look at the logs they're clean don't lie i would never say such a thing i wish you could hear my stream i'm paying a song just for you mind waves i think that the important takeaway here is that um regard because this is kind of a separate
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13157,discussion um that i find helpful is that when i try to confront people on inconsistencies or things that they say that i disagree with i try to work within their framework because if i assume my own then obviously i'm going to disagree with every single thing they say like very reasonably
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13171,so i i should i must so i think like the big problem with this discussion is that pixie said i believe that rights exist independent of a state um you interpreted that in some sort of utilitarian framework um in some sort of anti-realist utilitarian framework whereas she's working from
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13189,a some intuitionism or whatever some some sort of like um like a moral realist framework um so to attack her when when your frameworks are quite different means that both of you are basically going to be like shouting past each other because my guess is going to be that if you agreed with
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13205,her and her moral framework that humans have some in it some rights that exist independent of everything else so these are just features that are facts of the world that then rights obviously would exist independent of a state right you probably agree with that if if if like you should not be
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13221,murdered that was a fact of the world not an opinion if that was a fact of the world you probably agree that well that fact that could lead us to a right of not being murdered um is something that
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13231,would resist exist regardless of a state right i mean i feel like you're just asking me like if i agreed with pixies framework would i agree with her conclusion i think the uh the answer is like obviously yes right yeah so then the the way to attack somebody else's ideas i think is you
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13250,either have to demonstrate an inconsistency in their framework and show them that their own framework fails um or you or you have to attack the framework itself but you can't take a person's idea that exists in their framework and then analyze it in your own framework and then tell
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13266,them why it doesn't work because it that doesn't really make sense right does it make sense by say that yeah yeah yeah true yeah like if somebody were to tell me in order for me in order for me
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13277,to go to heaven um i need to just say five hail marries and then i can do whatever the fuck i want if i was going to argue against a person like that my argument wouldn't be well god doesn't exist
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13287,you dumb well it could be that would be like a beginning point but my argument wouldn't be like oh well saying five hail marries isn't going to save you and then they're like why and it's like well because that doesn't do anything it's like okay well what do you mean it doesn't do anything
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13296,like it would either be a conversation within the religion where i would say well true contrition doesn't happen by just saying a prayer you have to mean it and then you have to do an act or service to make up for it or i would say i'm going to challenge your entire framework
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13307,but i can't just attack ideas within their framework from my own framework because we're both going to be talking past each other the entire time does that make sense sure i guess yeah so i have no interest in uh working within your framework because i think that you're wrong but uh i was
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13321,asking you about objective morality and that's where you were talking about and where i was talking about we derive it from emotion and logic and where you argued no because emotion is entirely illogical and i was like no yeah it absolutely is cool and then you argued well
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13337,not well i didn't even know where we went afterwards because you were saying you can have logical or moral frameworks without emotion but at the end of the day it's right back to emotion sure so i guess i guess what i would have to do is i would try to somehow poke
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13355,like i i don't know like how you'd have to find out i would necessarily like attack your framework um i guess that like i would have to push back on this this claim that you like the i would
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13366,have to push back on your ability to like make this uh like sort of um objectivity claim that like when you claim that like um morality is is objective um kind of like try to poke holes in that but um
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13380,yeah you'd have to find me an example of a moral argument that somehow does not lead back to emotion which i don't think is possible it's i feel like this would come down to like what do we define as
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13398,like emotion then right like um i mean it's a feeling it's how you feel sure so yeah i don't know much much more to talk about this until i guess that can be answered it just it feels like a really weasily argument to say that because my emotions exist then we can we can
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13431,therefore conclude that right uh that morality exists because uh because emotions and then because it my argument is like logic but emotion plus logic and all morality all like you know humans should be treated this way humans shouldn't be treated that way goes back to like whether it's
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13454,logical to treat them that way or not and whether when when you're saying like emotions plus logic equals morality then like how do you do that math where what does that even mean well you start with your feeling right i feel afraid then you start then you get promises right like how basic
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13478,logic works use make a set of premises and a conclusion so you know if this person attacks me then my life will be in danger therefore um if if there is a knife then there is danger therefore if a person has a knife and attacks me like my life is in danger that equals fear that
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13503,makes sense it makes sense why you're scared because you're like sure but how do you derive morality from that well literally that what i just said like you basically make a bunch of premises to justify your emotion or not and if there's a hole in your premise or a hole in your
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13518,conclusion does that necessarily make it moral though well generally speaking yeah if you have ground-type premises with a ground-tight conclusion and if like you know if they all make sense in the terms like how to make the world better couldn't couldn't we think of something that is like
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13537,logical and based off of emotion but that doesn't necessarily isn't necessarily moral right like um yeah you can create things like that but what i'm talking about like how you create morality right so you couldn't have some like i'm trying to think about chocolate is good to eat or like
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13558,you know chocolate tastes good i like chocolate therefore chocolate is good but that's not a moral statement so if morality goes back to like how would you treat the world around you to make it better here's a question each other let's say that you have two parents okay let's say that somebody
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13577,tells you that both of these parents are in charge of making the rules okay you've got mom and you've got dad i'll be gendered here okay let's say that mom and dad are both in charge of making the rules
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13589,let's say that every single time mom says you can do something you have to check with the dad first to make sure it's actually okay if this was the case would you say that both people were truly involved in making the rules yeah if mom never has the ability to supersede the dad or if the dad
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13609,constantly has the ability to overrule the mom does it really seem like both players are in charge of making the rules here if the mother can always be overruled well no wouldn't you wouldn't the child just go with the one that agrees with them no no no we're saying who ultimately sets what the rule
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13625,is so for instance the mom might say okay well if you really want to you can go to the park and then you check with dad and it's like no you can't you actually can't do that or let's say but this
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13634,uh-huh sorry i don't know okay but this is this is a whole idea you if you go to dad with a rule that mom didn't make then like dad would either i guess like automatically shut it down or dad
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13647,like it wouldn't be existing the rule has to be posed first by mom so as long as mom creates rules or starts a rules um that doesn't have the power that only has a power to say yes or no
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13661,no so yeah they both have like the both share in that power well i would wouldn't the mom just be delegating her power to the dad um not exactly right well kind yes and no i don't know how to explain
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13677,this properly um yes in the sense that dad has a final say no in the sense that he cannot create the rule what if dad could create the rule if dad could create the rule then yeah dad has more power
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13697,are we able to say that you can create rules out of logic or no i'm saying that all logic like all morality derives from emotion and then logic so does it have to though couldn't you just use logic well no because it always goes back to it because it feels good or because my experience
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13714,is better because i feel like that's bad well then every action is inherently emotional then um unless if you're a sociopath yeah like every action does do sociopaths not have rights oh i get that question all the time and then that goes like social construct the contract
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13732,theory right i have a whole idea that as long as you acknowledge humans as a whole um can partake in this and as long as a person is like playing by the rules then why not but i'm speaking like in general terms so so then you you could acknowledge that emotion doesn't
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13749,have to play any role in the in the decision making on whether or not somebody should have rights um i'm saying that society as a general starts with emotion to then have logic at starts with emotion and then logic to create a framework of morality i don't think it's possible to create a framework
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13767,morality without initially having emotion if we were all born sociopaths we wouldn't have been able to create this framework to begin with hello hi i'm ready right i close one yeah i just don't i don't know how to like really push back against that like i feel like i would have to point you
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13798,towards an example where um emotion either shouldn't or wouldn't be involved in the the decision on whether or not something's moral and i don't know if i've worked it out that much i don't know okay so then here would be a question for pixie let's say that um it almost feels like that
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13819,our emotions are working as some sort of heuristic here for what what harms us let's say um you you used earlier that you see a car coming at you you dodge it without thinking and that's an example of emotion short cutting you to logic right mm-hmm what about somebody that's crossing a street
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13832,and sees a black person because they're worried that they're going to get robbed well that's why i would say it's emotion plus logic so emotions can be irrational but that's why we introduce like a logical framework to deduce whether it's irrational or not so i would say their fear is irrational and
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13851,why would you say their fear is irrational if ultimately what if it traces back to an emotion where they just don't want to be around black people what if that's what it like ultimately traces back to that they would rather just not even risk it that even a 1% chance or a 0.5%
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13862,chance of getting robbed by a black person isn't worth it well yeah that's why i said the emotion can be illogical but that is well how is that emotion illogical the emotion to not want to be around a black person how are you allowed to say that's an illogical emotion well why are you afraid
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13876,of being around the black person maybe they just don't like it with that question okay why don't you like it they don't like the way they look okay so i guess you technically can feel whatever you want to feel towards other people but it can be explained like why that why you shouldn't feel
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13895,that way if a person just doesn't like the way black people look why shouldn't they feel that way because black people are then it goes back to like okay how do you make like society a better place black people are also people what if they want a society with no black people what if they don't
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13912,really consider them the same type of person as a white person well then it would go to the whole argument that we i guess would have like different frameworks to morality because well no they're using the your exact framework here they're making a decision based on their emotion the way that
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13925,they feel about black people and then they're using what logic logic how can you command somebody by logic to like a certain race of person okay maybe i wasn't being necessarily clear enough so morality usually define or morality the way that we generally sees it or that people generally see it
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13945,is as like kind of a set of rules kind of but not really or more like a set of values that we should have in order to make the world a better place you know but when you say better you're begging
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13956,the question what do you mean by better like what would make a world with black and white people better than a world with just white people so then it comes to a question of like okay harmonious more advanced one where we can like generally agree less crime less people in harm overall happiness
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13978,things like this um things that generally make feel make people feel better so when you talk about feeling better or you talk about less crime so right now white nationalists could argue if we got rid of all black people in the United States with the snap of our fingers arguably we would
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,13992,have less crime and then they would feel more harmonious because they're around the color white people and they don't have to worry about black people yeah then i would make the law the argument that that's illogical because people commit crime not on virtue of their skin but because of
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14006,underlying factors well it doesn't really matter on virtue of why they commit the crime it's just the reality that they do so they would feel that that would be strong enough justification combined with their earlier feelings that they just don't want to be around them that they ought to be able
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14018,to like exclude them from society as a result of that no well no because the idea would be then other people would take over um those spots of crime theoretically speaking like as a population increases and as people are still stuck in poverty so as long as that exists well but white people
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14035,wouldn't be stuck in poverty the same way that black people are right because you wouldn't have that that racist sentiment basically would be gone at least towards black people um i guess like i'm not sure if i completely agree with that because i do agree that historically
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14051,speaking black people have been stuck in a system of poverty because of their race um because the factors affected by race but i would also argue that as things currently stand right now um because of even though race can affect your definitely historically is the reason why you're
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14070,probably poor um as well can affect your like job chances or you being able to go to places um your zip code also has a huge effect on your ability to ascertain an education so i would just argue that as long as like this like system of inequalities exist you're going as even if you
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14090,like get rid of black people people who are now stuck like i'm seen as like lower because of their lower class or because of their lower zip code um are going to take that place and you're going to have to like argue that all those people should be bad now and then you really think that
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14106,if we got rid of all black people in society that white people would all of us would inherit all the same characteristics of african-americans that they wouldn't be able to say no no no not all the characteristics of african-americans we put it this way yesterday when you were arguing with
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14121,white supremacists you said you know i think it just like wanted an easy target um if it wasn't jews it's going to turn into like brown-haired and blonde-haired people blue-eyed or brown-eyed people etc etc etc i think that if you got rid of all african-americans um it's not going to be in
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14139,the same level of slavery but i do think because of like the hierarchy um these white nationals imposed they're going to find a new enemy against them sure it's possible sure but the even the way that they even the way that they face that like uh subjugation uh or or discrimination would be
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14156,very different than um like the way that like black people would right like i don't think that like to me it feels like you're saying that like um it kind of is like you you're saying that like the
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14168,the only reason that black people are discriminated against is because of their class and like their social status um and not because they're just uh-huh yeah and never and never because of their blackness right no no no no what i'm saying is that because of their race they're in the lower
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14182,class and lower status um historically speaking and that also contributes to like basically like kind of like a circle of um discrimination but the whole argument for these white supremacist and specific is oh if we got all rid of all black people we would live in a utopia because there
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14200,would be less crime but these people like as long as you have this underlying system where it's like hierarchical and you have people in poverty and you have like these white supremacists to by definition like think that they're superior because of the race their target is going to in
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14216,a very really big shift because we know white supremacy isn't actually like 100% about oh you know about like actually thinking that you're better than blacks or whatever it's definitely part of that but it's also these people are extremely insecure um they feel slighted by the world
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14235,they feel like they need an enemy to go against so even if black people didn't exist white supremacists would undoubtedly find another target to hate on um and justify it by your class just by their hair color eye color whatever it might be so like that's what it basically boils
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14255,down to you get rid of all black people for white supremacists that sound can be fucking enough for them um they're still going to have to find something that they feel superior to because that's what their whole ideology relies on the ability to feel superior to another being
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14272,and at the same time be able to play a victim sure but all of this is besides the fact that they might believe that like a better world could exist without black people but that's like an emotion that you can't really just like how can you tell somebody that that emotion is wrong
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14288,yeah you feel the world would be better without black people so then you'd have to make a logical argument of why it would not well the logic is that you don't like black people and getting rid of black people gets rid of something you don't like it's just an emotion that's it um i'm trying to
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14304,think about a different way to phrase this i guess um your emotion is dislike and your object of dislike is black people so i wouldn't complete like the whole emotion is disliking of black people i wouldn't say the first the first um concept here is dislike and then the second one is what
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14324,it's attached to sure so say you dislike black people because of the nature of black people and by nature i just mean just you just don't like black people now that they have a particular nature which is by virgin white yeah okay so you dislike black people because of their mere existence
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14341,then you have to ask yourself why which is why do you feel any emotion at all why do they have to ask themselves that well i'm not i'm trying to construct like a moral framework and the only way that you can like create logical um yeah but the problem is that like in constructing this
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14357,moral framework it seems like you're appealing to a moral framework that's going to give you like a conclusion that you already like agree with but they might not want it they don't think they have to ask themselves why maybe they think that like well this is enough for me i just don't
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14368,like them and you don't have to force me to it would be like asking me why i don't like spinach and you forcing me to eat it or something when i could just eat another type of green or something
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14376,well then yeah it goes back to the whole idea that we have a completely different framework and morality because for them asking and asking but for them the motion is enough well doesn't that mean that it's not objective but i think the problem is that you're using the same framework
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14389,you're just starting at different points so the question the problem is that it seems as though using this framework it seems like you'd have a hard time resolving somebody using the same framework but just having different uh premises so they might start with the premise like well
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14402,black people are undesirable they might start there and then they might build from there and that's just based on an emotion but you said that using emotion or intuition is a good way to arrive or discover a moral fact that like using intuitions and emotions is a good way for doing that so if
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14415,that's true well it's a starting point so we both have completely different starting points because my starting point is literally dislike um and then everything else comes afterwards and you're saying their primary emotion is disliked for black people so that's that's a completely different
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14433,starting point because my whole idea doesn't that show that it's not objective doesn't that show that it like it's subjective based on whatever the individual uh values well no because at the end of the day we're talking about the general framework that i think most people agree with if
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14449,not any if not every it's how to live like moralities how is the values that we should have sure but objectivity isn't based off of like a majority of people agreeing yeah yeah okay okay let me finish um the whole idea of moralities is a set of values to live in a better world so we can disagree on
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14467,what those set of values are to live in a better world but if i can find flaws in your logic or what i would argue is that there's going to be inevitably flaws in one of our arguments or
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14478,one of our lines of logic um because like the answer would only result in like one way or not the other if they're both contradictory yeah my only problem i guess with this type of system is that if somebody else has a different emotional feeling than you then you're kind of like fucked
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14498,like you can't really say anything to that person you just have to accept that they just might want to eradicate all black people but if we're using like intuition as a justification for emotion and then like the only way we can challenge that is with some core principle of not liking black
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14512,people we kind of just have to accept that and it doesn't seem like we have the ability to fight back against that early so that's how i feel well i don't know if i was like trying to be clear
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14521,enough but this is why i was trying to emphasize so much that of black people would be a premise or would be like a different object wouldn't be the feeling per se the feeling the original core feeling is dislike and then it's why do i have this like oh i have this dislike because um they're
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14539,black okay why do i dislike them because of black and then if it's just like oh for their mere insistence of being black i guess my argument would be i don't buy that per se there has to be
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14549,what i could do but then well who would you convince them of that though they might say do i can't buy that you what sorry my two people would oh yeah sorry yeah so if somebody says to you then i don't buy that you can seriously like black people it's insane like if they say that
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14563,they don't buy that aren't you kind of both stuck on the same page like either of you can kind of get off the ground with your arguments because you have that fundamental disagreement that's by definition irreconcilable because it all starts with feeling or emotion well then my argument to
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14576,meet to them would be like well i can prove that black people are create like a more harmonious or better society but those words are both begging the question right when you say harmonious or better they would also say well my society is harmonious and better it's harmonious because it only has
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14592,white people and it's better because it doesn't have black people but those words are both like presupposing well what is harmonious or what is better or good yeah i was about to say that then i'd have to make them define what better or harmonious is harmonious is one group of people that i'll
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14605,look the same living together and then yeah better would be a rejection of anybody that doesn't look like yeah sure the same skin color at least for those people living together okay so then um if that is they're honest to god definition of what would be a better harmonious society to them
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14625,then you know yes we're stuck like okay there's no way to like contradict that per se but then again i would argue that their emotions are lacking logic or that they're we're not going to say your emotions are lacking logic it's right you're you're more out your moral
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14643,framework is lacking logic well but they're using they're using your moral framework they're just starting with different premises but the premise since because this is so this is kind of my own problem is that like your if your premises are essentially founded in your emotional response
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14659,to things then you can't really it seems like you can't really argue with them like you just have to accept it okay fine like well no because that's why that's why i'm trying to say it's not just emotion it's emotion plus logic so it sounds like when you say i'm sorry i'm in order god
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14675,when you say i dislike i don't know like i dislike apples or whatever then it goes to why do you dislike apples oh i dislike apples because i taste bad because i taste bad because they taste bad um therefore i do not like apples um so the whole idea is that you start with whatever emotion you
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14696,feel and you ask yourself why or you start trying to find like logical reasons for why that would make sense or why it wouldn't yeah but at the end you can't argue with them like you're essentially saying it's emotion plus logic but what you really mean to say is like it's emotion plus if i don't
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14712,agree with your emotion it's my logic until your emotion is wrong like for we can follow that same thing for instance i don't like apples so how do you argue with me if i say like apples are evil
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14719,we need to get rid of them because i don't like them well i would ask you why do you think they're evil because i just don't like the the nature of what an apple is i don't like the object that is an apple
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14729,okay i think i found the main contradiction here um for that you're it's like kind of like circular logic right um which i would reject i would say that your premises cannot be the same as your emotion they have to they can derive from it but it cannot be the same thing so you can't say
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14748,i dislike black people because i dislike black people why can you start with i like black people then okay so i like black people let's start there well why are you allowed to start well that's an emotion right not a premise well yeah no you're allowed to start with i dislike black people okay
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14765,but your your next premise cannot be because they're black people because i dislike black people because that's circular logic it's well but when if we're starting with emotion of course all emotion is going to be circular if i punch you in the face and i say and you go well i don't like
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14780,being punched in the face and i go well why and you say well because i don't like the feeling of being punched in the face i can't say like well that's circular logic you're not thinking about your emotion right an emotional response is by definition unjustified it's just something that happens and
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14792,occurs with us right well that's why i said it's plus logic that's when you start asking yourself like that's when you start going deeper and deeper so i don't like getting punched into the pit uh punched in the face why okay because it hurts okay and i don't like somebody says sure
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14807,somebody says i don't like being in the same area as a black person because it makes me upset okay then you ask why does it make you upset it's just the emotional feel why do things hurt you um because the physical contact of your of your like fist going into my face damages
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14824,myself okay and the physical contact of the receptors in your eyes like permitting the blackness of that person like it evokes an emotional response for me right yeah but then you're then you have to ask like is it a valid response like does it vary to a being black like actually
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14842,well what would be invalid about it it's an emotion is your is it valid for you to get punched and not like being punched just because it hurts you is that valid i would say it's valid because there's
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14851,a very real effect to that well not really i mean like well there's also there's also a very real psychological effect that like humans associate the like the color black or darker colors with like grief or morbidity right like the idea of death so or even more even more like what if i could
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14869,point to some types of pain that are actually good so for instance is working out evil because your muscles hurt the next day but that's that's i guess i'm maybe like maybe i'm just repeating myself too much um that's where you introduce logic and i feel like hi guys i i guess it just
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14887,feels like the frustration that i have with this system is it feels like basically you have an emotion if you disagree with the emotion then you're introducing something called logic but all logic really is is trying to find out some reason why this emotion is bad because it disagrees with what
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14900,you consider to be good or bad but that like that you can't logically invalidate somebody's emotional response to something like it's just not possible right yes we can't necessarily logically like invalidate it but we can argue like why it wouldn't make sense in a framework of morality um if you're
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14917,talking about the overall like happiness of everybody but that's where that's where it goes back to the question of do we agree on what morality is because if my definition of morality is you know i like our system of morality is to create like overall like general good for people um or rules
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14935,out or supposed rules or values that we should have to create a general good for everybody but your definition morality excludes everybody and only focuses on white people then we're not going to agree with what morality we should have in place period hmm okay
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14953,question anyways going back to our initial your initial disagreement i think it's important to reconcile your guys's fundamental disagreements for attacking each other on twitter about like lower order disagreements does that make sense hmm like i think it's pretty obvious when pixie tweets out your rights exist independent of a
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14983,state i mean i don't think she's stupid enough to think that like well without a state i'll never be murdered right that would be like a pretty uncharitable reading of her to say that yeah absolutely yeah so i think it's pretty obvious that she's talking about some sort of inalienable or intrinsic
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,14999,right that exists to a person so the disagreement would be there right yeah i guess i would um yeah because i i do reject your framework because i feel like um i feel like people can reach different conclusions uh using like the sort of framework that you've
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15015,laid out for what is moral and then from what is moral to what is a right um but we can reject somebody's framework that is just that is something that i would well yeah that that's something that i would have to like work out and figure out exactly why yeah and we can reject somebody's
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15029,framework but still accept their conclusions so for instance i 100 trillion percent reject her framework i mean pixie's framework is like how she makes like moral decisions but when she says like i think you can have rights independent of a state like yeah that makes sense of course if
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15043,you believe that rights are something that are like um intrinsic to a person then yeah that's a logically consistent statement of course i would never argue with that we might have an argument over like our rights or our is morality something like that is discoverable in the world or something
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15055,but i would never argue with that particular statement because what she's saying makes total sense right in terms of like how she views it right and how a lot of people view rights right i think yeah i would say most people probably view rights as like things that are not uh things that are
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15068,discoverable everybody that's religious for instance believes that rights are discoverable and a lot of moral philosophers believe that rights are discoverable as well right right run that by me one more time just so i the the last part i didn't catch that so
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15085,it's looking at the way that she views um morality all of her conclusions make sense so if we had a problem with um if we had a problem with how she viewed morality um oh my god how did i run out of
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15102,power i'm so sorry okay everything that she says makes sense within her own system so if we were to fight against her the fight would be against the system not about any point made within the particular system does that make sense first time don't you know any so you would have to hold on
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15120,i'm sorry hold on i'm sorry once i think you mentioned he was a socialist but he seemed to have a really racist conspiratorial outlook on society sorry i am not really deep into political stuff thanks though socialist can be racist socialism has nothing to do with whether or not you're racist or not
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15137,generally if you're a socialist or communist you're usually more concerned about class rather than political or rather than different types of identities like race but it's entirely possible to be a racist anti-socialist right nazimals or whatever like you can be that it's not like uh it's not a
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15152,contradiction or whatever um that's the gave a counter example of how what if a white supremacist thinks that the world would be better without black people and then my counter argument to that basically boiled down to well we technically would have a different definition of morality
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15168,because my morality is the better of all people and white supremacists would claim that you know their definition morality would specify white people so you would have to find either a way that you can have a system of morals that doesn't go back to how you feel
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15189,oh sorry i just want to button isn't the issue here more the verbage of what's going on and how you said like i don't think anyone would have an issue if you said people should always be able to do this versus the state has historically violated human rights human rights can exist
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15204,with or without a state maybe right so it's more maybe a phrasing issue um well i think my argument still makes sense there because it's a whole idea that even without a state those rights would still exist like but you can argue that the best way to protect those rights is with a state um which
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15227,i don't necessarily disagree with but it's not like the state doesn't exist rights don't exist yeah i don't know how i would reconcile that necessarily i feel like um long-seated you guys don't hate me each other well i i just like i guess i'm not i'm just not really not in concern
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15251,i'm really not concerned with whether or not they exist but rather which i've already said right but rather not like whether or not like what what is the utility of like the the rights right like like um how we're able to enact them and enforce them etc yeah but like that would be like a good
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15266,discussion to bring up so like she tweets out something like well what does a right matter if there's not a state there to enforce it like that's a separate discussion than just saying like well rights only come from states those are two fundamentally different claims right
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15277,yeah yeah i love both you guys good job keep up the great work correct answer is don't get fights on on twitter wrong i just like that didn't i wouldn't have these debates come on on twitter are the only reason worth living that's why i'm so but people try to up those engagements
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15304,come on people like you destroyed that stuff it's all marketing in bots now guys like destiny is a virgin holland it's 90% robots talking to each other and some journey a bunch of people uh people fighting but who's beside the robots are on well some
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15323,other are real people that talk to each other we say it on the global these two people are real people i'm a real person right i i actually think mind waves is a bot um there we go that's the kind
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15334,of content we work on here at shadow ink we're proud to encourage everyone to give up on humanity and just accept that you will spend the rest of your lives in a little box is a that's the solution to all philosophical questions nothing exists
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15353,oh good job guys i'm proud of all of you okay talk to you later alligators be careful later pixie good job you guys i just want you to know i'm smashing a specific key on my uh soundboard for
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15371,you right now fuck off dan this is why i hate philosophy it's all fucking bullshit amen wait dan why are you smashing a specific key what does the job you know uh since an in joke you wouldn't get it oh my god i wish it was cool
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15405,i'm really impressed by the tenure of that conversation honestly no joke gotcha i'm sorry i didn't scream at each other anything well i don't think it's very necessary like i yeah yeah there was there was no reason to go
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15421,hard on that one is this the tenure of most conversations agents that i i miss out on outside the occasional when i see a viral one most of them are screaming you should see me in pixie's last conversation more other conversations on twitter
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15448,i'm fucking running in a fucking oh no what the fuck i'm just start a war in the movies damn dan you won that debate with the fuck this poll says so dan did you really did you crush him democracy it's beautiful oh shit it's a fucking landslide
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15465,good job dan listen mindwave we tried to hype you up you know mind why why is gg hyping up the man huh is it is it just because i'm a man and she's a woman is your energy much more that's why i mean now i think i'm a close up democracy
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15488,true you know you look the same as rational disconnect right you do have you called rational disconnect looks the same as me all right fuck off you guys are identical i think his hairline's still a little bit better than mine unfortunately
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15517,forgive me i i have a vague understanding i i have a decent understanding of steven's shtick i have a vague understanding of dan's part-time streamer part-time work person i don't know who you who you are mr mindwaves i'm just a and i say i just i just i just do a podcast
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15536,on twitch that's all i fuck i'm like a scuffed fucking Raj that's all i am he um posts the number one racist uh political podcast on twitch actually oh but you've got you've forgot you've forgot sex sex as well exactly so i'm guessing you're the top of the charts uh yeah let's not talk about
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15559,stats all right honestly i don't even know if i want to do the podcast anymore it's something i fucking go back and forth on like you're doing what the fucking it up yeah how come i just um i don't
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15576,know it's so hard to make it entertaining i feel like it's just liberals against the fucking socialist and there are no fucking conservatives on this platform and i yeah it's all this exactly and i i like anytime i've like like debated something like one of my fucking like conservatives like
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15592,they just never want to associate with me ever again like fucking they like now they all go to like tree illogics podcast and shit like that like they just absolutely refuse to come on like lecture fan is like too busy doing fucking bible studies like the people that even come on my
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15606,fucking show the market doesn't reward debate rewards uh memes well you know basically well memes and rewards echo chambers well that's the thing is that like i don't want to fucking make a show like fucking hers like i don't know like i don't want to make another fucking Raj royale where it's
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15625,fucking like just memes 24 seven and then the person that talks the loudest or most fucking like i don't know dude it's just yeah i don't know i gotta figure out something with the like the format of the podcast because the saying it i feel like last month i was causing controversy
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15641,for you left and right the last one mind waves i thought you would appreciate that's that's that's that's our medium and you get are you copying him for that that's good work true yeah if it wasn't for damn i wouldn't have half the content i do on half these episodes yeah i do my part i like
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15663,to help out the smaller man when i can i want to have him succeed sure i worked one of the things i did when i was working in politics was basic it's as dumb as it sounds it was a multimedia strategy
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15678,of the 21st century but basically it was summed down to encourage everyone to engage on alternative media do you know before even i met desk uh steven and was like encouraging people to go on podcasts like that and including the production of podcasts for congress congressional campaigns
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15694,which were large enough and which can self-maintain like honestly the secret to content is having either like a rotating set of guests like or just a reality tap into people from outside of it one of the most successful people who pulled this off um blank he has an honest name i am
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15712,worried um he was he was the guy who lost the uh democrat uh primary against uh tom perez uh shoot he was he was he was later the dem he they were fighting for who had to be the lead of the
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15727,democrat party uh whatever the that role is in blanking on it oh god spent a year a couple years hi destiny in regards to this character debate if society is capable do you think there is any value in subsidizing an old rdk a opera even if there is less and less demand for it
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15745,it's only for the sake of preserving it we do it in universities right like a weekly podcast you need to have someone wait do you how many guests do you have so this is the thing is it like it's
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15757,hardly even a podcast i call it that but it's really just a fucking panel show like uh it's like it's like eight people exactly it's like eight people a fucking podcast and like the guests come in and out and shit you know it's like that's eight people's be hard like do you have someone doing that full
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15774,time uh like what do you mean getting guests and stuff like that like that's a full time yeah i have a dude that like helps me produce it like he helps do all the invites and i just do the fucking topics
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15787,ooh eight people's hard uh but um what helped with elison was at first like we we worked on mostly like there's only so many people who were friends of his like this is congressmen someone else so this is attorney geralstone so so but what helped was just our willingness to tap the shoulders of
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15803,just um people who weren't in politics but did policy but not like people who were at the washington post but just like yeah we tapped uh local activists local community college person and at first it was hard because it was only so many people killing like hit people and like
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15819,close enough to the studio but then we realized like hey man this is 2017 everyone's got micro has decent microphone and headphones that have just on their iphone and so that was well enough for us to get rotings i guess it's just more you might need to accept that not all aid your guests can
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15834,consistently be people with social media profiles right and eight panel eight and eight panel guest show might be a bit much to put if i it bit from my first professional perspective and i feel like the format's a little bit flawed because like there's this expectation of me to be like both
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15857,the the host and the moderator and i feel like it it fucking it cucks me from being able to like actually contribute to the show well if you want to be like i can't be moderator you can't do that
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15867,and contribute right exactly right so it's like otherwise i alienate like certain guests from even appearing on my show like if i push back against them or like go too hard on them or some shit like then they're just not gonna get them back so a solution to them might be um if you're gonna if
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15882,you want to play what do you feel your stronger skill is the host of the moderator uh host is that the job you want to do of that of those choices that's the thing is i don't even know
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15895,anymore like i feel like when i go on other fucking like panel shows or whatever like i feel like i'm way more entertaining like there's way more content like uh there than when i'm like actually hosting it like i don't know i feel like um so potentially i feel like i have to be a robot when
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15912,i'm like hosting or moderating either yeah well when when you're moderating you need to do that but with a host you can play you can play into the character whether it be playing with the heel or just playing into like a personal character you've created for the show um something worth
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15924,while maybe considering it i mean it changes up the ratio but maybe if you're more on the except like yourself as one of the quote characters in the show it might be easier just to get a guest moderator who has some expertise subject who's going to call people out
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15939,yeah that's something i've kind of considered um i kind of looked at like um um you guys know how like uh train wrecks does like the scuff podcast and how he has kind of um he has uh Devin kind of like do the the moderating and like uh bringing up the topics and shit
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15957,i was thinking about bringing in somebody else to kind of fulfill that role and then it would kind of like free me up to do like better participation like yeah yeah that's a lot of people consider a lot of people make fun of bill marin real time but like his format's really clear
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15974,because the century he plays to pay on the guess either he plays like toal heel or he plays like well i'm pla- i'm playing as like the avatar of my audience convinced me which works depending on who the guests aren't like them it's a good format he doesn't partially because he's got a
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,15988,smaller panel show and they're more mature so he doesn't really he doesn't really need moderate just assume like the air of respectability is the moderator his kind of character makes sense it's a to eat something to feel a playoff of more if you can leverage that as your own personal
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16001,character that works really well but again i think i mean this is my outside twitch shows there's no major show that has eight people on it like even see it ends with using sounds like six yeah that's true
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16027,you got any good good jokes mind waves fuck no okay dan are you gonna be my moderator you want to what okay you'd be a terrible fucking moderate false first of all i am the best moderator that anyone has ever seen look at any of my moderated debates they're amazing they're
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16049,on track they get going quick where i'm fair and balanced what are you talking about listen back in the day there was the startups thing all right i did a fantastic job if it wasn't for me Steve would have one disaster republican no they're all amazing episodes all of them from start to finish
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16068,wait a minute were you the guy who the first time i appeared on a stream after i left you were like talking shit about me about saying that i had no idea how like like the guests oh yeah he was
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16078,yep yeah that sounds right so actually i mean i'm gonna say i say talking shit but like your criticism was fair your skepticism was fair i i stand that was that you could be that steven could be a politician and i stand by 100 percent no no no you're specifically i'm
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16097,that's a different discussion and if you want we could have that but i'm not sure if this is probably i want to state more on the media of how podcasts and guests work isn't you offered that your that i i actually looked up your your podcast after that and i found uh
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16111,i found oh here comes the big highly successful podcast by the way but go ahead you had like six episodes that were like you know what barely monthly i'm sorry how many episodes were there in star wars sometimes you do it right and you stop when the stop ends good you don't keep going
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16126,dragging it out anyways the the one oh the reason a law tech podcast struggle is because like if they're gonna be like a guest format where it's one the two people like interviewing a second a third fourth person you need to be able to bring some value to get to those guests and the
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16142,reality is a lot of people in tech don't need the social capital from a b-tier podcast if they want that their marketing department would pay to put them on with scott galloway on reco or something like that yeah but that's why i'm here to make it a tier i know if it was just steven bt tier
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16156,but with respect act act act like the mid like the like the a tier for that is like recode and it's essentially it's part of the various marketing departments that that doesn't tech companies and the problem was because even if your audience is at scale unless there's someone who's gonna come
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16173,in like here is the new iphone case or whatever this one's just gonna come on their self product they don't love reason to go there they're unlike versus like a social capital format like twitch or like youtube whatever works social credit is very important that's where the value is that's
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16189,why there's a million billion comedy and acting podcast because fundamentally those industries are completely tied around networking and personal brand okay first of all these audio podcasts are nothing i'm posting a link in chat right now go ahead and click that and tell me if you've ever
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16202,seen an audio podcast that has that type of uh interact the answer is you happen which chat nevermind good meme Dan you're trying real hard there Dan believes that the video format brings superior meaning-ification to the podcast that the audio is i agree i agree
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16229,video is is the superior format mostly because every if you have a if you have a product if you can play on every platform possible you would do it off video just being another platform performance makes it valuable but still like the problem of tech is not the people you want
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16245,of his guess on rarely need to increase their social capital dramatically do you disagree i mean i didn't have the people i reached out to for the most part we could get them on that was never the issue and we had interesting people that came on and had good conversations with them
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16263,the issue is just such a pain in us finding people and then going through all the shit there was this fucking guy Richard Stalman i think i will never catch a limit except for this show a special example okay that that's not the norm it's not the norm but Jesus it was just it's too
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16278,much um so you can we can get big people it was just um uh well it's a lot of work came yeah the i mean i mean the hacker collective types are always are always really weird i think it's a understatement for him specifically but well definitely one of the weirdest guys on
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16295,the planet of course yeah i don't i don't know what the weirdest guy on the planet he's up there for sure i would give him the top one percentile weirdness factor oh i would he would he's in the
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16307,top one percent of the top one percent right he's an actual one percent he's the billionaire uh i don't know maybe someday more startups episodes if i get around to finding people that are interesting it's just oh Steve's a busy guy he's running 16 D&D campaigns and traveling me and
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16333,at least wherever my father what D&D campaigns are rarely very are rarely very profitable on the podcasting side it D&D is an experiential thing unless you're gonna be really dedicates the storytelling element it's yes i agree fuck you man it's a good experience you're gonna pay for the
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16354,experience of first-class fights i'm gonna pay for the experience doing a D&D podcast listen i'm telling you right now number one content on your stream once you're out here it's gonna be friday night poker nights you disagree maybe we'll see um it's a part of it's
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16370,going to depend on what kind of audience interaction there is like if you're gonna show your hand or not see yes we are so here's i already thought about this so i'm setting it up i have a table
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16379,that i mean i'm going to do all this in budget way which is basically we're gonna have a table you know with a little cutouts for the cards with glass and then cameras pointing at that so chat will see what each person has at every time now the problem is how the fuck do you play
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16393,poker when we're all going to be reading twitch chat at the same time or dg chat at the same time and the answer is you demand that chat must lie at all times and that if someone is actively
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16404,actually helping a person that they get banned so that's going to make things interesting you know that doesn't work right well i mean if you don't say did you see star wars i'm not saying anyone dies at the end no no well i mean that's the whole thing that's a banable offense right so the whole
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16417,idea behind it is that so many people are fucking meaning you have no idea what's real and what's not well but you may be able to ban people that are being truthful because that would be part of the
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16426,meaning otherwise you'd be impressed with elimination like if everybody's like oh Dan's got trips or whatever it's like oh oh i know he didn't like what what what might work better potentially i mean if you're willing to let people cheat that i mean that might be the best format just
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16439,except that the profits can come from the stream and not from the actual playing of poker well it's talking about a friend game so we're not i don't think he's planning on it like super profit so so if you're just one little people cheat then that might work um the other way is
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16450,you have a good uh host you can have the host play like just do color commentary and just the host interacts with the stream and then splits the profits between the people or when there was negotiated that might be good especially if a good host or whatever or a rotating host
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16464,i mean we're gambling doing these are still cash games but we'll probably do like oh holy shit it's fucking 1 a.m i need to go to sleep fuck you guys okay do you want to discuss uh the strength of a twist streamer or a congressional candidate no next time
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16483,she's not gonna do it there's no way Dan is a family man and everything okay you can do it i believe i got i have a home he's got life and kids he could show off the successful Russian
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16492,immigrant like they're troubles with my own logs out there i'm not saying that i'm gonna just pull a bite in instead that they're not mine but uh yeah i mean i i have some troubling past that i i'm gonna i don't know if it's gonna be a rough rough ride but you know what if you mess mess
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16506,as me with a platform i'm i can probably talk to someone about trying to get the removed i'm already on it don't worry about it i'm taking down the images day by day all right we're going okay hey destiny is it too late to take you up on that uh that anti uh or the no fucking bad bunny
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16523,no fucking anything con- stop the fuck up okay look that'll be very much okay like dude you can be my ho you could be my moderator okay so i'll listen in the background nobody ever says any crazy edgy shit while i'm there okay it's very frustrating
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16536,uh nationalize nationalize everything there you go hot take not really the problem is steve is you're not willing to burn bridges if you're wanting to burn what you're gonna have some good what i mean like okay excuse me i burn more
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16555,on this platform than fucking entire stream houses burn in a fucking two weeks okay okay let me rephrase this what i want more blood on these things okay with pixie and there's literally three clips of me on the front page of reddit with me telling my black friend trihex and i think
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16571,it's okay for me to say the end word privately even if it bothers him i don't know how you can get more extreme i don't know how you get more edgy okay i know what you're looking for i just want
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16579,more i'm sorry okay i have a taste and i'm thirsty that's all i'm drafting up the contract when i'm sending it to you destiny okay what percent of real was that um well actually 100 percent listen i do a lot of stuff on twitch this is your congressional
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16599,candidate by the way i mean i play well with low information i've dealt with dumb worship before i mean i i've had like look i've had the hot take that like i mean this has been discussed i us but like i do believe that there's going to be a coming in or gyration of people
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16619,who come out of the internet coming to politics and i think it's going to be a way that uniquely engages young people will will explain partially some of the quote young people gap when it comes to voting i think that's important further i do believe in and i think i i deal sense like
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16635,someone who comes from the smolys platforms who has experienced engaging large audiences over multi media formats would be useful as a representative sure oh it's deep can run on the uh don't ask don't say it in private uh private so what i think is useful is while there's gonna be a lot of stuff
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16656,there i and for good or for ales we america is a sort of post truth or semi post truth world and we'll say that it's a character and nothing else it's like that you've moved out of it's a
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16669,role you're no longer ending you're gonna be honest and true to the american people a lot of policies platitudes go to go press some skin and make it just just to be okay because it's you're obviously very serious about this i don't think steven is but if he did this he
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16686,would not be able to stream and make money anymore here we get weird with donations well during during the election which and no you could not make money anymore well if you came congress person who knows we'll cross that bridge what happens could you do it afterwards yeah he could
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16701,make profit on it i mean the one of the benefits running for office you can drop out and just stop doing it and be done to emfowl your paperwork can be done like if you if you do it for three
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16710,months it doesn't work you can you can end it like bloomberg so you're saying that we're gonna have to go like six months with no streams then yeah well i mean if he does if it i mean we're
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16721,we're off the like look for the record whether it be steven whether it be you mr dan or like again yeah there's oh let me be crystal clear i am not running for anything ever i'm not even running
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16733,for fucking comptroller of the fucking garbage department that's too high risk i'm talking i'm talking to genera whatever the person is i think it's gonna come the next a major congressional representative of the future is going to come out of all these platforms part of me is terrified
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16747,that's going to be someone partially manufactured but well from the right way because like if they get monopoly on that that could be kind of spooky what they could probably pull off so you're saying there's too many there's too many races on the right so we have to have some on the left now
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16760,well no i i don't want the right wing to get too motivated or too tied down and get too much in advantage of on this plot on any of these major multimedia platforms listen you've got to find someone that has a it could be anyone so some you literally pick the worst stream to find people
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16778,like i can't stress that enough wait listen i love you guys both very much okay but just fucking one am i'm i'm three hours past my god damn fucking stream and time okay all right so you tomorrow i love it wait destiny just imagine this if you got an endorsement from tolsea you'd
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16790,have the cumber vote on lock just imagine all right i'm not playing against i do want to be serious discussion about this okay we're doing yeah all right i'll tell everybody means all right i love you guys holy fuck it's fucking latest fuck i shouldn't be streaming
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16806,this much my fucking internet went out to fuck the whole day up oh this guy's really cool i'm gonna host this guy okay this guy is super cool okay i love you guys piece on wait fuck did that raid go through it i just fucking push it
D_td3kUDtRI,20200322,16850,i don't want it did my raid happen raid you already have a raid in progress say the meme oh river and a cappuccino pop china hop china Amb Sky
