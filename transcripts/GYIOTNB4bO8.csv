GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,0,you
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,72,of  my  I'm sorry, I didn't take a show.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,92,What time is on a man?  I'm a PST.  Jesus.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,118,This is not delivered every spits on packaging.  Coronavirus, why?  How blue are your balls from what?  What do you mean?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,140,This is your moon goddess Chipotle stone?  What are you doing?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,181,When are we watching boondocks episodes?  Hopefully soon.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,214,Much love, white people, happy.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,238,I thought that was a party.  7
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,263,What do I care about this?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,292,You read your crazy destiny.  I like you, but you're crazy.  Right now in New York City.  I need a video that's no more than three sardines long.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,312,Hey, this is Henry.  Where we go down there areuppress makers looking.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,337,I'm 46 years old.  Before acting to the Lily fought together, I would never leave a audience.  Because, of course, we can't have exponential growth forever.  At some point, the disease will run out of new people to infect, either because most people
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,360,have already been infected or because we as society manage to get it out of control.  But and this is the scary part to me, when you're in the middle of an exponential,  it's essentially impossible to tell when it's going to end.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,371,Are we in for 10 times as many cases as we currently have?  Or 100 times as many?  Or 1000?  Exactly.  What it feels like to be in the middle of a league loss streak.  Especially when exponential growth ends is important, because it hugely determines how
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,385,many people fall ill.  Yet so little reporting actually focuses at all on how to tell if exponential growth  is ending.  After talking about this with my friend, Autish, he put together a new graph visualizing the  COVID-19 epidemic on a global scale.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,397,This graph uses the real data and shows all countries traveling along the trajectory  of exponential growth.  And it makes it super obvious which ones have managed to stop the exponential spread  of disease.  They plummet downwards off the main sequence in a way I find super compelling.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,410,In this figure also makes it abundantly clear that even if a country doesn't have lots  of cases right now, COVID-19 is probably going to follow the same trajectory there and end  up spreading, and spreading, and spreading.  Until that country hits the emergency eject button.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,423,If you're planning for the future and your country doesn't have a lot of cases yet,  it's nevertheless a safe bet that you're probably headed down a similar path.  So how did we make this graph?  Well there are three key ideas.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,435,The first is to plot on a logarithmic scale, since that's the natural scale for exponential  growth.  And it's that the tick marks grow by multiples of 10, so 10, 100, 1000, rather than 10,  20, 30.  This scales up small numbers and scales down large numbers, making the growth equally apparent
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,450,on all scales, and lets us compare the growth in countries with very different numbers of  cases.  Which brings us to the second idea.  Catch changes early by looking at change itself.  For example, if you look at the growth of cases in South Korea, you can see that at first
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,462,they're exponential and later the growth slows down.  But when you're halfway up this curve, it's hard to tell by eye that it is slowing down.  It kind of still looks exponential.  If instead you chart the number of new cases in the last week, in other words, the rate
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,475,of growth, it's much easier to see that the growth is indeed starting to slow down.  And when the number of new cases each week flattens out or goes down, you've escaped  the scary exponential growth zone.  The third idea behind our graph is one from physics.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,488,Don't plot against time.  Usually, when you see exponential growth, the number of cases is plotted versus time.  But the spread of the disease doesn't care if it's March or April.  You'd only care about two cases.  We better get a conservative video review, Stephen or else.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,504,Bonus meme, no bonus meme.  Many new cases there will be today.  That is the total number of infections and the growth rate of infections.  The defining feature of exponential growth is that the number of new cases is proportional
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,518,to the number of existing cases.  Which means that if you plot new cases versus total cases, exponential growth appears as  a straight line.  So these are what we plotted on our graph.  The number of new cases, aka the growth rate, is on the y-axis.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,532,And the cumulative number of cases is on the x-axis, both on logarithmic scales.  This gives us a beautiful, horrible graph that shows where all countries are in their  COVID-19 journeys.  It makes it obvious that the disease is spreading in the same manner everywhere.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,545,We're all headed on the same trajectory, just shifted in time.  And it makes it obvious where public health measures, like testing, isolation, physical  distancing, and contact tracing, have started to beat back the disease.  And where they either aren't working, or haven't had time to show up in the data.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,559,In nearly every country so far, the number of cases grows at basically the same rate,  until it doesn't.  And that's what I feel like is missing from so much COVID-19 coverage.  A sense of whether or not we can see the light at the end of the tunnel.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,571,Are we still on the rocket ship of contagion, like the US?  Or have we managed to hit the emergency eject button, like China?  And this graph shows us that.  It gives us some sense of what's actually happening in these uncertain times.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,583,That said, this graph also has a number of caveats and limitations.  Its main goal is to emphasize deviations from exponential growth, that is, to amplify the  light at the end of the tunnel.  So it may be less informative for other purposes.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,594,So here are the caveats.  10,000 looks really close to 1,000 on a log scale.  This kind of distortion might allow people to take COVID-19 less seriously.  Also, the log scale on the x-axis makes it harder to see your resurgence of new infections
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,609,after a significant downturn.  A plot with a linear x-axis is better for that.  Unlike most other COVID-19 graphs you've probably seen, time isn't on the x-axis, which might  be confusing.  Instead, time is shown through an animation.  Another important caveat is that this graph, and basically every other COVID-19 graph you've
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,630,seen, isn't actually showing the true number of cases, just the number of detected cases.  The true number of cases is unknown, but certainly much higher than the number detected.  In reality, COVID-19 cases spread at a slower rate than what this data implies.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,646,It's kind of a subtle idea, but this data reflects not just increases in case numbers,  but also increases in the number of tests performed.  And since we're ramping up tests, it makes it look like the cases are growing faster
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,656,than they actually are.  But they're still growing.  The data we're using is incomplete, as it relies on daily reports from overburdened  healthcare systems around the world.  Also different countries have dramatic differences in the resources that are available and dedicated
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,669,for testing.  Finally, the trends in this plot are delayed a few days since we're plotting the average  growth rate over the last week.  There's just too much variability in the data to plot daily growth rates.  This is actually kind of a good thing.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,681,It means it's a pessimistic graph.  It doesn't get too excited too soon, and so a downward trend on the graph is much more  likely to be a real downward trend.  And a real downward trend is what we want for all countries.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,692,A lot of daily news just reports recent data points.  Yet to understand where we're headed, it's not enough to know just where we are today.  We need to be talking about trends.  How many new cases are there today relative to the number of new cases yesterday, or last
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,704,week?  Charting the rate of change empowers us all to more clearly see what the future holds.  A giant thanks to Atish Bhatia, who created the interactive visualization and helped write  this script.  Atish's work on this has been a beacon to me in these hard times.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,718,And this video was made possible by Brilliant.org, which I don't know if you know anybody who's  looking for interaction.  Okay, what a fucking nerd.  Got him.  Loadout is 8,400 dollars.  Loadout is way too cheap.  It seems like there's no point in like, I think more zone is really close to me.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,743,A really, really, really good game.  There's just like a couple things I think I would change.  The loadout is like way too, way too cheap.  I think the loadout should cost like 15,000, even 8,500 seems a little cheap.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,754,Like if you go uncontested in like a loot area, it's pretty easy to just, it's pretty  easy to walk away with like literally $10,000.  Like it's pretty insane.  Especially as a team, especially since the loadout like loads your whole team out.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,768,You could easily walk away from every 20,000.  What?  How did you get in here at the same time?  I did.  I saw you come in.  Do we cover the binary?  Saw me on the boxes reported on it.  Vox didn't report that he sexually saw someone.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,783,He reported on other people reporting it.  It'll be an eternity of like any, I don't know if you're like a huge Bernie bro.  So there's been, there's been like a strange like sexual assault allegation that has come  out against Biden.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,794,Like a few, a few of like the very like weird like kind of off media have like reported  on but no like mainstream media is has reported on it yet.  But like the Bernie bro is especially my subreddit are fucking furious about it.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,808,Holy shit.  Oh, there might be a Yahoo report about it.  I haven't seen that yet.  Yahoo is this, this media stuff.  Did you read that spell at all?  Hold on one second.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,833,What's strange about the accusation?  The lady has made some very weird like Russian esc statements in the past.  This week free time has been amazing.  Like some pretty fucking weird shit about that.  But she started deleting a whole bunch of before she came out publicly with her accusation.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,858,And then it would just be nice to see like mainstream media outlets like verify the story  because there's a lot that goes into like a lot of people think that just like oh person  makes accusations of someone oh well but then we report on it.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,867,But usually like the mainstream media outlets do a significant amount of work to actually  validate and verify the facts around the story.  What do you mean Russian ask like what I think so many copy pasted in my story.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,883,Maybe check hold on.  Oh, you guys have stepped up on the subreddit post by the way.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,904,Good job.  I'm pretty sure the D&D memes were legendary.  Wait, where are these posts?  No.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,924,Do you think the media did fair or point when we came to investigate in the cabinet memes?  I mean, Project Veritas tried to show that they were super biased and Wapo snuffed that  shit out immediately so I don't know.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,944,Somebody I wish I could remember what Reddit poster was.  Someone here was copy pasting some of the stuff she'd written on.  Someone in chat said that they had like wrote like a letter in Russian or whatever and it
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,958,was like with mail ending verbs or something.  I don't know about that.  Oh, yeah.  Just here are some things that she'd written in a blog.  Technically being pro-Russia or whatever doesn't mean that you also couldn't have been sexually
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,972,so popular.  It's possible that these things will happen.  Change your words into truth and then change the bet truth into love.  Lyrics from the song As by Stevie Wonder.  What have I told you that everything you learned about Russia was wrong?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,984,What have I told you as an American citizen we've been fed propaganda to further a certain  political agenda?  A political American agenda.  What have I told you that we are the bad guys and that we're on the wrong side of history?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,993,Our American empire is falling and failing not because of some imagined threat from a foreign  nation but because of our collective greed.  Greed is what runs our economy and greed is what will destroy America.  I'm not being paid to write my political opinions nor am I being hired by someone to do it.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1006,I'm writing about this subject for the same reason I got into politics.  I care for my local community, my global community.  I believe in service to my fellow citizens.  It's the most important work community or is the most important work I'll ever do.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1016,I love my country about a reflection of our collective dysfunction and our need to move  in a better direction.  When I was in my early 20s and just out of college I began my journey to politics.  I left that political work behind a few years ago.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1026,I was out of my position and took myself out of the Washington DC Beltway.  Why first I started as an actor in classical theater and artist and writer before Washington  DC.  This work in the arts has always been my first love and my best vocation.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1036,A second I saw the reckless imperialism of America, the pain it caused throughout the  world, third I love Russia with all my heart.  I love the people, the history, the culture and even my attempts to learn the language.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1045,I cannot stand to watch the deception and xenophobia that came from my own American government.  So sad and destructive to revile another culture or country for no reason for economic gain.  President Putin scares the power leading America because he's a compassionate, caring visionary
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1058,leader.  President Putin has higher approval ratings in America than the American president.  President Putin is beloved by Russia and he's not going anywhere.  Instead of being ensnared in the recent political intrigues and America's trying hard to set  that trap, President Putin is keeping a calm focus on his own country's development in
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1072,the future without America.  Keep your eyes to the beautiful future and maybe, just maybe America will come to see  Russia as I do with eyes of love to all my Russian friends.  Happy holidays and Happy New Year's.  Alexandra Tereid, JD.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1085,I don't know, there's just a lot of weird stuff around this.  I mean if it gets vetted and validated by some more incredible mainstream media sources,  I mean yeah for sure.  I mean I think it should be investigated of course.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1099,What is JD?  JD is Juris Doctorate, which I think means you have a law degree but you haven't taken  the bar exam.  Are you signing up for the poker thing today?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1129,Anybody can play.  America's card room, even you, anyone.  Metal Gear Solid.  Just watch the DSP Metal Gear Solid.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1150,Just watch the DSP Metal Gear series and the seventh game in order of the timeline.  It takes place six years after Metal Gear 2's solid snake who is a secret agent that has  to infiltrate Shadow Moses which is a secret base that was captured by Foxhound who is
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1162,holding the United States hostage for the remains of Big Boss who is the same guy as  Solid Snake except with an eyepatch.  Solid Snake not Big Boss sneaks into the air vent to save DARPA Chief but then he dies.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1174,So you fight a man called Evolver Asalat but your duel is interrupted by a mysterious  ninja called Gray Fox who is a man called Frank Jager who used to be in Foxhound but  then defected to Zanzibar because he wasn't loved with a former figure skater from Czechoslovakia.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1190,Because he is a robot he has to cut off Revolver Asalat's hand.  Then Snake finds a peeing man called Adakan who was the son of a famous scientist that  killed himself because his second wife cheated on him with his own son.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1202,You see, Adakan's father, Huey Emmerich built Metal Gear Zeke for Naked Snake and then built  Metal Gear Solanfer piss for a man called Skollface.  This is why Adakan builds a secret robot called Metal Gear Rex for a man called Liquid Snake
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1215,who was a clone of Solid Snake created from the DNA of Big Boss who was also known as  Naked Snake who was both of their fathers and he has an eyepatch.  Solid Snake is tricked into activating Metal Gear because Campbell thought that Miller
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1227,was not Liquid Snake but he actually was but turns out Revolver Asalat was actually  a double agent the entire time and was secretly working for the third Snake brother called  Solid Snake who was also the President of the United States and has a Dr. Octopus suit
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1243,with plane growers on it and he has an eyepatch.  Are you following me so far?  Next we have Metal Gear Solid 2.  This is where things start to get a little confusing two years after Shadow Moses.  I'm going to say the plot of the main game is super straightforward compared to Metal
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1256,Gear Solid 2.  Alright, we'll stop here.  I don't want to spoil everything in case we can play through Metal Gear Solid 2 as well.  Holy shit.  In case implying.  Oh my god.  7 o'clock EST.  That's two hours.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1278,Three.  Okay, where is this hat guys?  It must be under private.  Oh.  It starts today in the 27th of March right here.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1300,At 7 EST is 1900 EST which is 1600 which is in three hours.  Oh, Twitch Poker Epic Battle.  $2,500 guaranteed turny.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1320,Three people enrolled.  There.  The password for this tournament is...  Oh, I didn't make it in my thing.  I'm sorry.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1345,It's Epic Poker 3.  Epic Poker 3.  Any caps?  Nope.  It's got a $2.20 buy-in so good luck.  What have you done today, Moot?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1366,Wait it has a buy-in?  Yep, $2.20.  Fuck.  Yeah, get fucked.  Do you know how much that is?  For our trillionaire streamer like you.  Oh.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1387,How much money has H Bomber Guide donated to the COVID shit?  Somebody please tell me.  Please please please please please show me where he's donating money.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1413,These rich fucking lefties are really starting to piss me off.  How many fucking patrons do you think this guy has?  6140.  The minimum Patreon is $2 a month so bare minimum he's making over 12,000 a month just on Patreon.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1428,That's bare minimum.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1449,Someone calculated under a separate base of the final pay transit ship in the Vid, the  minimum he makes is $18,000 a month.  Oh, well, okay.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1472,Remember guys, these guys are just like you.  These guys are just like you.  They're poor.  They're just like you guys.  But to them, that money is table scraps and the wealth inequality is a huge factor in  this pandemic.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1485,Hey guys, thank you so much for watching my video about how neoliberal-  This guy's a prophet.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1506,Some commodifies everything.  I'm just a small lefty content creator on this platform and you guys know how hard it  is staying independent.  That's why I'm going to ask that if you have anything to spare at all, please donate to
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1516,my Patreon and let's defeat neoliberal capitalism together.  One year later, guys, I have been blown away by your generosity.  Thanks to your help, I'm able to improve my video quality and make even better video  essays against capitalism.  At this rate, we are closer than ever to a more inclusive, fairer society.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1535,So keep funding the revolution and buy my merchandise that just released.  One year later, guys, I am so proud of how much trash in this channel is getting.  We are already at $10,000 a month.  The bourgeoisie is trembling.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1547,Remember guys, install raid shadow legends and level up those characters so they too  can get strong enough to defeat capitalism.  And go to NordVPN.com slash j-r-e-g to hide from spooky authoritarian capitalist threats.  One year later.  I am now a libertarian.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1571,Surprise, this video is actually sponsored by NordVPN.  You've probably already heard from foreign people.  I have these posts in my sub real.  Kind of doing napkin math, I got 36 frames assuming hitting more than one frame is wrong
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1586,you can do it and then put it in a minute and then he does a math here.  So this guy makes at least $201,612 a year.  This is just on patreon by the way, this doesn't include sponsors or ad revenue.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1596,Or any other types of money you might make.  $200,000 a year.  And that amount is not even close enough to retire.  So if you all think YouTube content creators is a stable enough job to make donating any  portion of your income possible, your delusional.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1608,It's not fiscally responsible to live a life of luxury or for to donate even a single dollar  because there's a million ways a source of income could disappear tomorrow or could  do a more stable job.  And just in case anybody calls me a fanboy of this guy, I think donating 400 pieces to
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1620,medical staff in this crisis is fucking smart.  I agree how much it should be applauded because you can't throw my name as a part.  Dude.  Who is um, does H bomb guy, does he have a family, does he have kids or anything?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1634,Like one individual 200,000 a year.  Holy shit.  That's so much fucking money.  Calm down, sweetie.  No, the oil friends was a real chat.  What's the code Steven or what's the what you called again?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1657,Sorry.  Dude.  These guys are so disgusting.  It's epic poker three.  Why do they, why are they out here acting like they're like you?  They're not like you.  They'll cast you aside.  Morals are only as good as society allows them to be.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1674,To them, you're just a freak.  And what was the game named Destiny?  Um, it's like the twitch poker thing or whatever.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1697,He doesn't donate money privately.  He's lying because he knows there's no way that anybody could ever call him out on it.  100%.  I really want to drop this.  What a fucking loser.  Keep in mind that somebody worth 45 million could divest 95% of their wealth and still
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1721,be a millionaire.  What a stupid fucking statement.  If you make more than a million dollars a year, you should instead give that money to  me.  I'm poor guys.  Just like you guys.  I'm just like you guys.  We're all poor this together, right?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1741,I'm just like you.  We're all poor together guys, right?  Anyone else having trouble paying the rent?  Anyone else can before the rent.  Touchtag times up Biden.  Uh oh.  The Bernie Bros.  They're out in force today guys.  Biden Bros.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1759,Hold strong.  The girls are on me.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1783,Debate her about dog whistles.  She's on Twitch.  This isn't the person that I traumatized last time, is it?  That was sound nice.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1806,Oh.  If this girl wanted to do it, I would.  No lefty will debate me over land lordship because they are so hilariously fucking stupid  when it comes to anything having to do with housing.  It's a fucking joke.  I'll teach you this.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1822,This is my hair.  This is my pretty point.  Holy shit.  Is there a way to block specific subreddit to my phone?  You can't.  Because there's like every single subreddit is a fucking Sanders subreddit.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1842,Politics is, world news is, our president, Sanders for president.  Feel the burn.  There's like 17 different Sanders subreddits and they've taken over all of the political  ones too.  It's so fucking stupid.  Holy shit.  What was it?  What did we see yesterday?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1858,A few days ago, it was like the top of our world news with some girl tweeting landlord  bad.  That was like the top post.  What are you doing?  What the fuck is this?  Sorry.  What are you saying?  I was going to say, I think if you want to block the subreddits, you have to do it on
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1872,your PC and then it will block on mobile.  I couldn't find out how to do it on mobile.  Oh, maybe.  Oh, yeah.  Presidential race memes has turned into a Sanders cesspool.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1900,You know, liberals are the only safe haven.  Good one, Kat.  Are we playing, uh, Halo today?  Maybe.  Wait.  Moot.  If you read the actual Reddit post, his tenant organized to pay for maintenance themselves  and everything they're doing, a run-strict-from-out that organized from the pride of a lot.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1922,That post was fake as fuck.  They had already verified that post was fake.  It was just made by some dipshit left to trigger everybody or to trigger the other landlords  or whatever.  I actually think it was worse in 2016.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1934,Why was it?  It might have been, but that's-well, it was only worse in 2016 because Bernie was alive  for longer there.  Like his campaign died, like, really hard after Super Tuesday at this time, so you haven't  seen him as much.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1944,Wait, there's a chance still, right?  Um, no.  When there are Azimans and Super Tuesday, shut up.  What about the math?  Oh, yeah.  That's another thing too.  Hold on.  Shut up.  Top 1% earners, United Kingdom.  Dude, H. Bomber Guy.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1966,Percent of total wealth owned.  How do you, uh, what is the top-top 1% median income UK?  Does he actually pretend to be poor?  Well, he-when he's like tweeting, like, if you make a million dollars, give it to me
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1981,instead.  Like, come on, dude.  This guy is, like, so fucking wealthy.  To be in the top 1% of income taxpayers in the UK, i.e., to be among the 310,000 individuals  of the highest income, a taxable income of at least 160,000 quid is required.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,1997,Which is 160,000 pounds to USD.  So 200-so he's in the top 1%.  He's literally in the top 1% in income, in the United Kingdom.  And he's fucking crying about-it was just a joke.  Fuck outta here.  Not acting like these fucking lefties don't pretend that they're like you.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,2018,Don't pretend that they're poor like you.  They struggle like you.  That they're in cells like you.  That they don't-that they-they really just like you guys.  Because they're so fucking scared that they're gonna be seen as the bougie fucks that they
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,2027,spent most of their poor life rallying against.  It's 100% not a joke.  It's-it is super intentional, dudes.  It's just a yoke, dude.  Okay.  Man the fuck up.  Or listen.  We're playing Doom, right?  We're playing Doom, Extra Life mode, okay?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,2046,Okay.  I need to turn on my post-made stuff too.  Hold on.  Wait, read the solips of something.  Oh, I'm gonna do the as well right now then.  Alright, hold on one second.  Oh no, he's so dead.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,2078,I'm dead in here too.  This thing is so stupid.  Yeah, you can't even like hold on to it.  Yeah, it's weird.  Look at the S&P 500 today.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,2099,Just as bad as any other days.  Shit is fucked.  Oh.  We're still positive on the five-year time.  Oh, what are you talking about?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,2125,It's a good-ass meme spell.  Jesus Christ.  Thank you.  But I think Koi-Ri is gonna ban it.  Listen, you're just about as similar to Phantasmal Fort.  How would level you?  In the other campaign, I'm level six.  I'm almost level seven, so I'm about to be able to use the spell.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,2139,So, in your usual spell is similar to Phantasmal Fort's other illusion magic, except that the  priest who cast the spell is the only creature who automatically believes the results of  the spell.  You automatically believe the results of a spell you cast?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,2153,Eum...  Spell creates the illusion of any object, creature or force, as long as it's in the boundaries  of the spell's area of effect.  The illusion is visual and tactile, that is, it could be seen and felt, but no other sensory
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,2162,stimuli are created.  It's gonna be seen and felt.  Solipsism is the opposite of normal illusions, in that anyone other than the cast are much  like an active effort to believe, rather than disbelieve the illusion.  Characters trying to believe the reality of a solipsistic illusion must make a seventh
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,2176,go over a breath weapon, modified by the magical defense, adjustment for wisdom.  Successful save means that the character believes the illusion, and it is part of reality for  him.  A failed save means that the character cannot convince himself of the illusion's reality,
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,2188,and the illusion has no effect on him.  A character can make a single attempt to believe each round.  Unlike true illusions, the image created by the spell that's more than just duplicate  reality, the image formed is real for those who believe it.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,2198,The illusion has all the normal properties that its form and function allow.  The solipsistic bridge, spending a chasm, could be crushed by the priest unless he believed.  All those who see the priest apparently walking out into nothingness.  Likewise, the solipsistic giant would cause real damage to those who believed it.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,2210,The illusion remains an effect for as long as the priest continues to concentrate on it  until the priest is struck in combat or until he's rendered unconscious.  So enemies would never believe things basically, right?  Correct.  But what I think you could do is, well, I guess the question runs down to it, it made
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,2223,it an easy example.  If I make an, if it's raining outside and I saw upsize an umbrella, do you think that  the rain goes through the umbrella?  Because if the rain doesn't go through the umbrella, then I can in theory, created solipsistic
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,2238,giant and have that giant throw real rocks at people and it would hit them, even if they  don't believe in the giant.  Okay, I'm, oh, this is, it breaks, it doesn't work.  It breaks.  So the argument would be that no, the reason why that wouldn't work is because the rain
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,2252,drops wouldn't believe in the illusion.  Okay.  And then I get sleep with it, but then I don't know how you can feel touch and feel.  Well, oh no, no, the touch and feel is only by things that believe in it.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,2263,So whatever thing you create shouldn't be able to interact with any environment at all.  So then if I create boots and I put the boots on, it will leave no footprint.  If you create boots and put the boots on, it will leave no footprints.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,2276,Correct.  That should be true because you'll be hovering over the ground.  That would be the theory, right?  And then I think we could probably break it that way.  How, wait, could you create like a healing totem for your party and they actually get
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,2295,healed from it or something?  Like, hi, I was thinking about that.  I don't think you can create magic.  You can't create magic stuff that happens.  But another thing that I was thinking was like, what if I create like a big thing of
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,2305,food and then my party eats it?  Would they stay nourished?  Because it creates, it says in the spell, you get all of like whatever the property would  be.  So I would also think the rain wouldn't go through it.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,2318,Koibu, I asked him and he said it kind of breaks down.  It gets weird and gets fucking.  He said it only stops the rain for those that believe it is there, which splits reality  into two camps.  If you see it's there, then I'm not getting wet.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,2332,But if you don't see it's there, then both of us are wet.  So what the fuck?  He said the whole thing should probably be removed.  Yeah, it seems like we get really confusing and complicated.  Dang, it's incredibly fucking.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,2343,It's basically how far up we'll see if we can practically go.  I mean, in the spell description, you can create a giant that'll beat the shit out of  you.  How would the cast ever believe in the illusion?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,2384,In the spell description, it says you automatically believe it.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,2414,In December, I write here about considering switching to monthly on Patreon instead of  using the current per system per video system.  I think I would benefit creatively from the push of committing to getting things done in  a more consistent schedule.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,2427,Imagine thinking, what a bullshit argument.  Hey, I could pay you per video or I could pay you just monthly based on whatever amount  of work you do.  What do you think would motivate you to get more work done?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,2437,Well, let's see, if you're paying me per video, I'm literally getting paid for every video  that I complete.  That seems like a pretty big motivator or I could just collect that easy, fat, check  every month.  Ah, let's just do the monthly thing.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,2445,This is the most backwards-ass fucking reasoning I've ever heard in my entire life.  This is backwards, right?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,2476,What happening, this is backwards.  Uh, so that's the thing, right?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,2501,Does con change the dicey role for HP gain or does it just give you a plus as a plus one and adds a plus one  So hold on so if you have a plus three and con you'll always have three extra HP. I'm really level. Yeah every level
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,2517,We'll power an int or really important letter for saves fuck that fuck that saves a shit  So if Nevids so my second stat  The thing is I built this character to be a fucking role player character  So I put my fucking my 15 with the goddamn wisdom
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,2538,Stupid if I had a plus two and con instead of in fucking wisdom  That would mean I would have two more HP per level  So being level five my max HP would be 33 instead of fucking 23  It's pretty good I
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,2554,Think  I think there's also I don't think I don't know if you'd ever get this  There's a tough feat which I think gives you an additional plus two every single level. So if you take that at level one I
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,2568,Mean you have an extra 10 HP at level five  Tough your head point maximum increases by amount equal to twice your level when you gain this feat  Whenever you gain a level thereafter your point maximum increases by an additional two hit points. Oh
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,2588,It's also retroactive. Oh, it's so it's basically retroactive. That's how that works. Yeah, huh?  There's a lot of nice feats  All the range from it's been nerfed to the fucking ground  So I Devin was right you should have played a fucking madely fighter dude I
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,2610,Like how 200,000 a year so top 1% income in UK is a for a single male with no family is a  slightly comfortable living  Isn't he literally the 1% at that yes in income he is the 1% well I guess technically we'd have to go back and count on
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,2642,Any videos it's possible that he has so much money that is just being lazy. He's fucking doesn't actually work at all  Okay
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,2664,Do you think empires of rakadia is gonna be canceled  Hmm, I mean you would know more than anybody else has there been talking to the indie group  Sounds like it's time for two brothers  It's sadly I was gonna go through right perfect
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,2709,You
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,2740,If I remember robert is a super amazing levels up you take two levels and fight it a booster each piece and really yeah, that's what I'm doing  What about the Sony talks I got an email from them a while like a week ago actually so things are still moving along
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,2754,It just takes everything in the business world has been completely fucked recently. Let's take them a while but  Most the opportunities around through Sony so far have been like for like events and shit  I had the opportunity to go see like a funimation movie recently, but I had to turn it down because the
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,2770,Democratic debates are going on that night. I couldn't miss them  It sounded like business was going on as usual from koi boom  Then in the session he said down when I just missed a session then maybe I'm still planning to run for a political office
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,2797,I don't know my dude  Hold on okay, I'll be back and then we're gonna start okay once again meeting so yeah, who's got the timer gone

GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,3099,It's like my least favorite thing.  Here we go.  Two cups of coffee.  Thank you Larry.  Thank you so much for coming in Mr. Hand.  Oh yeah.  How's that scone?  Not so much a scone.  No, it's a scone.  This is like a muffin.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,3111,I mean I'm just saying like there's kind of a specific quality that a scone has.  It's sort of dry and crumbly.  This is sweet.  It's a little more like a muffin than a scone.  You're describing it as stale scone.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,3120,That's a fresh one.  I'm not sure you know what the definition of a scone is.  It looks good I think.  I'm just saying.  Let's not worry about it.  You want me to take it away?  No, I'm going to keep the muffin.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,3131,Thank you very much.  You enjoyed the scone.  Yeah, I enjoyed the muffin.  I'm good.  Thank you.  Great, thank you.  It doesn't matter.  Yeah, it doesn't have any good time.  Oh, so when I first met Mocha Joe.  Oh, oh hold on.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,3146,No, no, no.  Mocha Joe, Mocha.  Yeah.  There's coffees.  It's not hot.  There's plenty hot.  No, it's plenty not.  It's hot.  It is at best, Luke.  Oh God.  I don't know what to tell you.  This is not hot.  There's not a hot cup of coffee.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,3165,It's a hot cup of coffee.  Coffee should be served hot.  This is not hot.  It's hot.  I'm baked a dip for this.  It's not hot.  I don't know what you're going to do.  But I'm going to do it.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,3172,Do you still have a hot cup of coffee?  Oh, oh.  It doesn't even hurt.  This coffee is not hot.  Don't hear.  You have turned it to Larry.  I'm done.  I can't do this.  God.  Cheryl.  No.  Come on.  Nope.

GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,3263,Thank you.  Mmm.  It's a little soft.  What, the scone?  Yeah, scones are supposed to be hard.  This is like a muffin.  Well, not really.  It's supposed to be fresh.  Yeah, fresh hard.  Well, that's a fresh scone.  I'm not quite sure you know where the scone is, Mocha Joe.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,3282,Oh, I know where the scone is.  Do you?  Yeah.  You might have a looser definition of scone than I do.  I don't think it's really open to interpretation, though.  You want the scone or not?  Yeah, I'll keep the scone slash muffin.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,3295,So you're going to keep the scone?  Yeah, muffin.  Yeah.  Enjoy the scone, Larry.  You got any danish's?  No.  Fucking up.  What the fuck?  Next.  Oh, my God.  What is this table?  Wow.  You believe it?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,3315,Wow.  Hey, Mocha Joe.  Yeah.  Check out this table.  Yeah.  It's a wobbly table.  Yeah, we'll stop moving it.  Stop moving it.  It's every time I lean on it, it's going to move.  Put your foot on it like everybody else does.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,3330,I'm going to sit with my foot on the table.  Yeah, that's how you hold it now.  The floor's a wobbly.  Mocha Joe, can I give you a little advice?  Yeah.  Nobody likes a wobbly table.  Fastest way to lose customers is with wobbly tables.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,3342,I got an uncle with a wobbly leg.  I can't stay in that motherfucker.  Leading on shit all the time.  Mm.  Tastes your coffee.  Cold.  It's cold.  Hey, man.  Yeah.  Mocha Joe.  What?  This is cold coffee.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,3364,Whoa, whoa, wait a second.  That coffee is not cold.  Is your coffee?  Your coffee's hot, right?  Look, we don't want to be fucking heaters right now.  What is this?  It's cold.  Can I get a new cup?  No.  So you're not going to give me a new cup?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,3377,No.  Because that's a hot cup of coffee.  It was hot when I gave it to you.  That's a hot cup of coffee.  It's a hot cup of coffee.  It was hot when I gave it to you.  You just stick your nose in a hot cup of coffee?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,3385,Why would you stick your nose in a cup of coffee?  I want to prove to you that it's cold coffee.  Watch this.  That's cold coffee.  That doesn't prove anything.  Except that you're an old ball nut.  What'd you say to me?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,3397,You heard me.  Now get out, your old ball fuck.  With pleasure.  You think I want to sit here with a wobbly table and drink cold black coffee?  No, thank you.  Yeah, good.  Get out.  Hey, Larry might be one of two of those things, but not all three.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,3410,Happy New Year, Larry.  Happy New Year, Mark and Joe.  Jesus.  Moot, are you fucking ready?  I'm working on it.  Goddamn it, I've heard the show is good.  I will share time.  I'm only streaming nine hours a week for now on our day or a week.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,3430,Oh wait, this isn't even the fucking one I'm talking about.  There's a show called Berry that I've gotten recommended to me so much that nobody talks  to.  Or I'm sorry, nobody talks about this show.  It's supposed to be pretty good.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,3446,Is it?  Everyone says it's good.  Look, everybody says it's good, but nobody talks about it.  Fuck me.  All right.  When season two comes out all the time.  Oh, is there only one season up?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,3482,Oh wait, did I ever tell you?  Wait.

GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,3540,So I ordered it again and now it comes and it's just the wrong order.  It's not what I ordered.  There's a fucking salad.  You think I ordered a goddamn salad?  No, I put sweet plantains on there and I didn't get those.

GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,8712,There's a time limit?  Maybe they go blue to orange and then they unglow.  He did glow orange?  My colorblind?  Wait link the clip.  They only glow orange if you do a lot of damage.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,8737,I've never seen them in my life.  They're out of range.  Why don't you go for the glory kill?  Wait what?  Holy shit I did not know this at all.  Wait is that true?  I thought blue meant you're good to go and I thought orange meant like they're almost

GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,8783,Wait what...  There has to be something here right?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,8820,dumping sure  What is this?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,8951,Th
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,8975,Whatever  Why wouldn't I be able to go that way?  There's some bullshit.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,9022,Who is the genie girl?  Is she the new like Asian of the week or whatever?  I've seen like four- Okay, so I see like seven posts about her and LSF this morning. Holy shit.  What aren't there?  I don't know if it's just- I'm getting racist to my old age, but I feel like every time I turn on LSF
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,9038,there's like a new like Asian girl that barely speaks English.  That's like the new LSF mascot for like a week.  That's what it feels like.  Yeah, and then they forget about them like hot chubby?  Yeah, and like yeah.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,9048,Well wait, is she still got decent beer shippers?  I don't know. I would assume so, but I just don't see her on LSF as much.  Why does it matter if she's Asian?  Because that's what people fetishize the fuck out of.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,9068,I don't know if it's an anime thing or like a perceived disposition that like Asian waifus  are like submissive, quiet, docile, whatever.  Oh wait, that time it worked.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,9089,Fuck you for wasting my fucking armor.  Yeah, I should have used the X to do it right now.  Fuck you for wasting my fucking armor.  Yeah, I should have used the X to do it right now.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,9113,Fuck you.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,9143,I'm not going to do it right now.  Reference does not equal fetish.  You can fetishize the fuck out of somebody's race with regardless of having a fucking preference.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,9166,I've talked to two different Asian girls that have dated a lot like in the California area  that run into a lot of white guys where it's like as soon as you start talking to them,  they're like, oh, so where are you from?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,9174,Oh, really China? Oh, I love blah, blah, blah, blah.  I do this and I know all about blah, blah, blah.  They're like so fucking excited to talk about fucking Chinese culture assumption.  Even though these women are like Chinese American who have never been to China lives
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,9188,and don't give a fuck about it.  I quit the fuck anything. Not, I don't know.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,9211,Easy comeback.  It is pretty omega weird.  The L.S. option.  You're pretty omega weird.  Adam.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,9235,Nice job, Moon. Thank you.  Take a moment to look around you.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,9261,Oh, yeah, the alt-right fetishizes the fuck out of Asian women too.  Because Asians are like another superior breeding stock race or whatever.  Why? Because they have like a higher IQ?  Something like that.  They say that like Asian people have a higher intellectual IQ, but white people have a higher creative IQ.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,9280,So it's okay.  So Asian and white people together are like the ultimate, whatever.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,9309,What the fuck?  Wait, that, not political though.  That didn't mean that it didn't pull it away.  Man, all this talk about Asian people should have me hungry.  Anybody want to order some Szechuan chicken?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,9331,Because if you order off a Postmates using my code, the first five orders get you $5 off.  And you get $100 in delivery credits for the first seven days you use it.  Amazing!  Did you see, uh, he called Oprah's husband a beta.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,9355,Is he even the guest house?  Um, I did not see that, but that also doesn't surprise us.  Pretty good beta, man.  Well, it's because, yeah, we know.  Not politics, probably.  Of course that would go through the problem.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,9396,Come over here, you...  What?  Steven, what's in my cheddar?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,9416,What?  Wait, you cut off like halfway through that, what do you think?  Is Postmates work outside?  I think you're saying did Postmates work outside of the US?  Um, I don't know.  Does it?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,9442,Sorry, my game was lagging, it was lagging me.  Do you think people have mic issues on Discord in 2020 should just be permanently banned from the Internet?  Yeah, 200%.  It took a lot of people who have this issue, it actually makes me question myself.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,9461,It's super weird, it makes me wonder if it feels like I'm like, when I hear people that have the Discord issues,  I feel like I'm the main character in like a movie.  I don't know, there's one where like, there's a lot of NPCs.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,9474,Oh, yeah?  Do you feel like an NPC, cause you're getting a Passable One?  Look at him, look at his head!  How many lives does the movie have, guys?  Ten?  Ten, that's it, that's pathetic.  How many times have you died?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,9497,What the fuck do I do here?  I saw a streamer say that Postmates is only for the Bourgeois.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,9518,It is, but you have a chance to join that Bourgeois by getting free delivery and $5 off your first five meals, guys.  Awesome, make sure to sign up, type in exclamation mark, Postmates and chat, sign up for it.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,9536,Shall I play poker?  I will be playing in that poker tournament with you a lot, yes.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,9556,That's what we need, thank you.  I'm not going to lose any armor to the bullshit barrels.  There we go, now we're getting it.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,9578,Just got Chipotle with Postmates free delivery, that's a good job, good one, dude.  No one cares, bro.  I care.  I'm carrying the revolution.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,9598,Remember, guys, the revolution will not be televised, so you need to get on the streets, you're going to be getting hungry.  Wait, not a political revolution, just a gamer revolution.  I don't know where the fuck you go.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,9620,No, that's another one.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,9649,You have other hallway, you have the key.  What?  I'm down and take the actual life in the red thing.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,9684,I'm going to go ahead and take the rest of the game.  These are grenades, I just noticed that.  Oh my god, I realized we're taking so much mystery damage from spiders.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,9713,No, I didn't mean to hit shit.  I'm laughing, we're laughing at you, Steven.  Look at your Twitch chat, they'll be laughing there.  I have the best emotes, don't I, chat?  I want it through.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,9747,The new agency, I take the locker room to make a democracy.  I'm going to save our ammo somehow, boys.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,9781,I see this run going differently.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,9810,I'm going to start talking.  I can stop.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,9847,I'm going to save our ammo.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,9930,I just got to...  Okay guys, we're going to make some key strategic differences this run.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,9957,I missed one extra life.  Wait, how?  If you say I'm missing shit and I'm not, you're trolling, I'm IP banning you.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,9978,No, you won't.  There's a secret.  What?  Extra lives aren't secrets.  Oh my god.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,10001,How many is he missed, chat?  Hold on, I got to pull up your channel and see the Pepe laughs.  Look at his fumble.  It's time for you to quit this one just like you did 80s.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,10026,You can farm extra lives and mission select.  Is that true?  That'd be stupid.  That's a band meme.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,10046,We're not allowed to do that in this run.  What the fuck am I supposed to do here?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,10069,Fuck, there should be no puzzles in Doom.  I signed up for a shooter and not a puzzler.  Every Doom game has historically had puzzles in it.  Dumb move.  The monkey bar.  Remember playing the old fucking, was it on DOS?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,10088,Doom, we'd walk around, mashing the space button or whatever on fucking walls to find the secrets.  Yeah, yeah.  Do headshots work on this thing?  Oh shit, I just blasted his head.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,10108,Headshots do more damage this thing.  Jesus.  Eight head IQ.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,10139,So often you 20 grand to play League again, would you take it?  No.  About 100%?  No.  About a million.  Maybe, huh?  Okay.  You have your price, chat.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,10164,Am I having a date?  What the fuck is this, Spider-Bitch?  We're gonna do it, guys.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,10187,Is this every time I jump, it doesn't have to recharge or anything?  The secret you always miss, wait, where are Dunebug?  Are you talking about the one that I went back and got last time?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,10208,That's bullshit, chat!  What?  It's at the bottom of the screen recharging.  Left on the wall now.  What the fuck?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,10236,I'm cool, me.  Oh, wait, this is so good, actually.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,10258,What's the best one, chat?  Someone don't even know what to do, thank you.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,10351,Dude!  It should, it does.  It doesn't seem like it.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,10377,There's a Baron.  That's pretty fast.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,10412,Wait, what?  Oh, okay.  I thought we fucked some horrible shit up.  It needed fast-warming through the tutorial though I think.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,10450,I'll give you insta-kill things, you still get the armor.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,10480,Oh, why did I even try?  So weird.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,10504,Guys, you should be signed up for that ACR poker tournament.  It's a $2.20 entrance fee.  I don't have $2.  $1,000 guaranteed prize pool.  What if you're in the middle of that tournament and you need to eat?  You only get 5 minute breaks, that's not enough time to run out and grab something.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,10522,But it is enough time to order something to be a postmates, guys.  Go ahead and type an exclamation mark postmates in the chat.  You know what's fucking amazing?  What?  You're drunk and you can't go anywhere.  You're having a good time playing video games with your friends and then you want to make
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,10539,flurry postmates at McFlurry too.  Yeah, what about those of us who don't have friends, like them?  That type of advertising is a little bit insensitive.  Yeah, you're right.  Why am I?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,10584,It's so bad.  Asking.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,10618,You know what I'm saying?  No, actually, no.  If you're there, it's not the pit because you're not going to make it there.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,10639,Thanks for making this Brit-bong quarantine more bearable.  Ha ha, the only bear here.  Right through the ground.  The living eye bear is, can't bear to stand you.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,10664,Oh.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,10692,I'm not sure.  Don't you have to act like a sponsor to have an add on the title where some indication of  the sponsor's fans?  You don't technically need add on the title, it's just supposed to be blatantly obvious
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,10709,that you're a sponsor.  I'm pretty sure it's pretty obvious that I've said multiple times with postmates and  sponsors.  I'm not just broing it out of the goodness of my heart.  Wait, what's that sponsor?  I can believe in the product and why don't we buy it without any sponsor?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,10724,I can believe in the product and be sponsored by it at the same time.  Are you a sponsor?  Yeah, of course.  Do you believe in the product?  Yeah, of course.  He's gone.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,10754,Did the armor disappear?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,10783,I didn't always forget the time, did it?  Go away.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,10833,you

GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,10879,So how many people are sent up for right now?  It's a sentinel power cord nearby.  If you use it to activate the map and clear a path forward.  Entrance 40 remaining for you.  So 40 out of 80?  Only 40 people signed up.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,10900,Oh, hold on.  There's an extra life in here too.  Chat, I don't know if I want to go.  I don't want to go to the pitch, chat.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,10929,Oh god no, this is going to be fucking irritating.  It is not in your title?  Oh, well the pass...  I'm in the pitch!  Epic Poker 3.  I typed it in chat.  That's the title to the...

GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,10979,Oh.  Okay.  I love how when I hold artists skip it.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,11008,Always waste my flame power.  It feels good.  Good jumps.  Have you died on this run?  Basically, should I miss an extra life?  Shut up, move.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,11033,Yeah, I'm going somewhere more.  Oh.

GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,13416,Like everything is like consistently themed and everything like from a I don't like that at all  Why like I mean her her shit looks good  But I don't like when it's just the same shit like if I if I go to a food page like for some of the chefs
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,13428,I follow I don't want to see the same style like the same fucking plate with just different food on it  I want to see something unique in each image. So it's not the same shit at all. It's different stuff in every picture

GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14169,it is it's like not the kleiboo's a bad DM in this case though this DMS versus  the player shit is complete horseshit as Gary Gygax style shit like you see a  trap and you die I hate this gameplay I hate it not giving players agency to be
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14182,able to imagine having the agency to see that all of your party is at half HP  having infinite time to make a decision and holding on to two level two heels  and then blaming the three level two heels and then blaming the DM that you
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14194,got one shot while sitting on resources oh my god fuck that's good  also had a level three concentration spell which you could use at any time  to make a bunch of things to go and scout oh yeah you could have used some
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14207,in animals to scout ahead and that's not even like thinking like that's not  even like oh I'm a backseat quarterbacking that's like just playing your  fucking character to like the correct limits like we literally to beg him just
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14217,to kill ninks you had to beg him to use level one spell slots how many cards  you need to get a goddamn straight in this fucking game do you think he I  don't think there's enough on the board for straight right I don't think there is
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14238,right no hold on nine ten does it matter wait does what matter I thought  this guy was both now right hey katerina just joined us tempo storm true  just okay I'm laughing actually I have a straight guys I had to straight the whole
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14261,time what is my stack position 22 of a four whoa what the fuck  any drama and you really are some huge nerds
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14292,I do see stack position there's a little graph thing you can click over here  that'll show you your position is 22 out of 84 how many people are left in  can we tell them well if I'm position 22 out of 84 I think I would go ahead and
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14308,venture guess that there are 84 people left in where you see that  that  that I read by yeah yeah I read but you got a problem with that kid  bring Devin in there and bring him in here right now bring him in all mauled for a
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14334,little bit  he call itham did you do drama how  it sounded
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14356,dumb  It's dumb, baby!  Yeah!
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14383,Oh, nay, Lynn!  Oh, no, no, no!  Hey, people are gonna stop shipping it.  Can I play the game?  Wonder if people are gonna stop shipping it?  Yeah, just like going all in on crazy shit.  Everyone is always gonna ship it, move it.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14405,Oh, the vines are done? Okay, good.  Thank God.  He wasted his last transformation.  Oh, yeah, he was still asking like 20 episodes in!  How long does my transformation last?  Oh, my God!  These are like the basics of your character.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14422,Like, you're at Druid.  You're level six.  It's your transform.  It's a little...  You were watching a lot of D&D stuff earlier in episode nine.  You guys discovered how long his transformation last.  Well, like, but that's episode nine.  Like, these are your old names.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14435,You should have been known before.  It's the main things you do.  Like, that would be like a barbarian asking every episode.  Like, how long does rage last?  What am I supposed to do with rage?  Like, I don't know.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14445,Okay, sorry.  Is it too late to sign up for the Ace of Turner?  You just missed it, my dude.  I'm sorry.  He also ran a level one spell slot to heal himself in Snake form.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14466,Oh, yeah, because he can expend his spell slots to...  That works though, right?  What do you mean?  Yeah, but then he didn't want to use the spell later to heal somebody.  Oh, yeah, not using spells later.  It's just, I don't know why, but...
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14482,Oh, the clip war has begun.  And he said he's not going to do...  And, like, I'm going to call him a...  I don't care anymore.  I'm not going to call him a C-  It's just dog shit DM.  That's one of the...
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14492,Not that C-  It's not that C-  It was a bad DM in this case though.  This DM's versus the player shit is complete horseshit.  It's Gary Gygax style shit.  Like, you see a trap and you die.  I hate this gameplay.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14501,I hate it.  Not getting players A to be able to...  I'm just going to have the agency to see that all of your party have that half HP.  I'm going to have the time to make a decision holding on to two level two heals and then
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14507,blowing three level two heals.  I don't want to do this like, this is like really dumb DD drama shit.  But I can have it if I can just fine.  I have an opinion.  This is just a standard DD drama shit.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14519,It's always like, dgg drama, debate tactics.  I feel like I've probably been...  You know how you know I'm confident?  You know I know I have a good grip on reality because I think I get gaslit more than literally
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14529,any other fucking person on the entire fucking internet.  Holy shit.  I have been gaslit from so many different corners of the internet from so many different kinds  of people.  Like it is unfuckable, believable.  Oh my god.  I thought he said D&D drama.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14546,Did he say D&D drama or dgg drama?  I thought he said dgg.  I couldn't miss her though.  The heal didn't carry over from snake farm.  Yeah, because if you stop in snake farm and then you retransform it doesn't do anything.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14561,Yeah, it doesn't come back with you.  To be fair, Chad is waving this up a bit.  Why don't they get me to be whipped up to say that for him to say Kweiboo is a dog shit  DM.  Or he's been dog shit DMing.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14576,No, I don't think he said dog shit DMing.  He said dog shit DMing.  He said this is just dog shit DMing.  And then I think after he's like, well I don't want to say Kweiboo is a bad DM.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14585,Sure.  I mean those are coming like dog shit.  Yeah.  It wasn't even a savor die.  He did the math and apparently at his current HP the 27 or whatever it was a 6% chance to  die.  And that's at half HP for him.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14599,If he would have used a single one of his three heals he would have been a hundo for some  times.  He would have been Kino.  Kino.  Or if he would have stayed as a snake.  What is this?  What are these flops?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14615,These flops are wild man.  That's not how Kino works.  Honestly I just use Kino for cool.  I think people get really mad so I just kept saying it.  I thought Kino is like amazing or cool.  I don't think it is.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14627,I think Kino refers to like if it's some piece of art that's like the best or some shit  or whatever.  Or I don't know some of these shit.  You know where I don't want this one.  I just said Kino and people get real bad.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14637,It's fucking Kino dude.  Are you going to debate the live posting person?  Yeah I would over any topic she wants over whether or not I'm conservative or anything.  But she won't talk to me.  I know these types of people.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14647,They like adamantly avoid confrontation at all costs and they only live inside their  little dipshit echo chambers.  That person will never ever ever ever be in the same call as me ever unless there's at  least seven other lefties and they're screaming at me as well.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14659,So they don't have to confront the fact they're utterly fucking clueless about any of the  things they talk about.  I'll debate you on anything.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah you dumb fucking cock.  Did Liv call you a conservative?  Incess.  Yeah she says I'm a conservative.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14673,Fuck why is this song?  He's not working.  Chat we need more song requests please.  Are you still in this tournament?  Yeah I'm at seven.  I've got eight K.  I want to go to Mr. Newton's table guys.  That's just what I want to be.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14694,I would destroy you if you're at my table.  I just like I'm going to destroy you and I would destroy you and poke.  Thank you Jacob for the gifted sub to Hollow Nekko.  The Uer.  Oh this Hollow Nekko guy, he's been in my chat for the past two or three days at every fucking
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14709,hour just ooing and it's a real person.  If you try to like talk to him, he'll like respond to you and everything.  It's fucking insane.  Wait it's a bot or what?  No it's a real person.  If you talk to him he'll respond.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14720,Wait what?  Yeah real people respond when you talk to him.  What do you mean?  Yeah I know but he's in my chat all the time ooing.  You said he's a bot or something.  No.  You just told me that there's a person in my chat who's a real person when you talk to
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14736,them they respond to you.  Is this like how you're using my chat?  Oh my god what do you think?  Maybe that's why I think I'm a bot.  Maybe that's why you think you're at NPC in a main character's movie.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14747,Dude you need to fucking get off to it and run Nuke's this more because you're losing it man.  I'm going to come here and watch some of that Nuke's this.  Oh my god.  By the way Nuke's this is a video game that's even I play.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14761,I think Mr. Mooten is looping.  Destiny you're on reference couch wake up.  Good boy.  Look at him.  Doo dee dee dee dee dee.  These men.  Last D&D clip.  Oh wait there's another one.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14788,Please no one close it right now.  I'm going L.N.  Wait this game I'm done.  Wait.  That guy has to go all unscrew you.  Fold out.  I have a jack.  I've got trips by the way.  Yeah you couldn't beat that.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14803,I didn't have trips by the way.  But he thought I did.  He thought I did.  Get him out of my hand.  Can't play conservatively with a chip stack.  You understand your character by episode 16?  Yeah I agree.  But there's 5 billion latest like 5 billion decisions you have to make a spell.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14814,You should understand your character by episode 16.  Yeah I agree.  But there's there's 5 billion latest like 5 billion decisions you have to make as spellcasters.  Nothing that Destiny is saying is wrong.  My argument is not against I could have played better.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14823,My argument is against the dog shit community that sends me dozens of DMs about how I have  to be more optimal and play in the way that they want.  And that negativity causes me to be very, be very frustrated with the campaign.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14831,In addition to that I also don't like the, I don't like a lot of the way that Neil DMs.  And I'm very clear about that.  But that doesn't mean that he's a bad DM.  It's just that people fucking clip shim shit.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14840,And they missed the whole part where I said he builds amazing worlds and like is like why you clip that shit.  Like he builds amazing worlds and is one of the best DMs I've played with.  You just want drama.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14847,I'm not going to give it to you.  You guys are so fucking petty.  Like you fucking DG people are so fucking petty.  And like literally just want me to go fight your favorite streamer.  Steven is my friend.  Shout out to my community and me fucking PTSD more people on the internet.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14858,Then any fucking other community in the world.  Yeah, dude.  We're like they think we're like some fucking nonsense.  You're the new 4chan.  Yeah, Jesus.  True.  Those 4chan DG peers.  Those DG peers.  Who is this DG?  Who is DG?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14873,Destiny clip.  If I had to summarize it in one sentence.  I don't agree with all of Neil's DMing style.  I wish that a lot of it was different.  I still really enjoy the campaign.  My core argument with the campaign is that I don't have fun because of the massive amount of negativity
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14889,that I got.  That would be my one sentence like summary.  Okay.  I'm folding this shit.  Okay, way two stars.  Where am I getting mood at?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14909,Why is mood out at my table with the moody kens?  I would destroy you.  Oh, this is so cute.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14933,What?  The guy to my left didn't call the guy to my right even though he fucking ate out stacks  him.  Oh my god.  Limp Thayer dude.  How many chips have you got moody?  I have 10.4.  I'm coming to my table.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14947,I'm coming.  I have to bust some of these guys out.  Coming busting.  Busting makes me feel good.  Dare.  The fuck do you even activate this?  That's one of busting.  Truth.  Dare.  You hit me with a dare.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14967,Oh, so good.  I'm so good.  Dare.  How the fuck do you do this?  Hit me with a dare.  Truth or dare?  Truth.  Dare.  Truth.  Dare.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,14988,Give me a dare.  Dare.  Oh, you just click on it.  Sorry about that.  Do something nice for a friend.  No thanks.  Way into stars.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15008,Fold.  You fold every fucking hand.  You're not a good gamer.  Okay?  You're trash.  You're trash kid.  You're trash.  Get him out of my goddamn hand.  Okay.  Let's see what I'm going for free.  Thanks.  I just hit my flush by the way.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15021,Just hit my flush by the way.  Yeah.  You worked a bit in my trap card.  How many chips do I think this little loser will fucking call?  Huh.  1,270.  That'll leave you with 2,000 chips.  You can pay to see this.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15034,I'm ready.  It's an easy pay.  Get this guy out of my goddamn hand.  Just fucking fold.  We all know you're folding.  Way to stars.  We all know you're folding.  You don't have shit.  Even if I didn't have the flush, you can't call.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15051,You probably like ace jack or some dumb shit.  You're not going to make a hero call.  Okay?  Lay it down.  You missed.  You have two overs and you missed.  You didn't hit.  You missed.  Now it's time to just put it away and go on to the next hand.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15063,Okay?  Thank you.  He won't even see this.  Of course.  I had two overs and I missed.  Oh, what did you say Mr. Witten?  You asked me how many chips I had?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15084,11,570.  Don't care.  We're busting over here.  Bustin, bustin, bustin, bustin, bustin, bustin.  Brrr!"
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15114,I feel good.  Boston makes me feel good.  I'm  Boston.  Ah!  What is this?  Oh, shit. It's a horse.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15136,Can we just both ship it on this neckband?  All right, baby.  I vow to ship it, chat, if he bows.  Dude, come somewhere in the middle.  What is going on?  Shoot it off.  I'm  I'm doing, I'm doing, well, all right, all right, all right.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15157,No, it's only five minutes. Stop. I'm getting a drink. Hold on.  Don't do it, Moot. I need to finish this round.  You're gonna finish it, Moot. Oh, you know what time it is?  You all know what time it is?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15172,Chad, no, if you do it, I will ban you and take your primes.  What do you think I'm gonna do?  You're gonna do the golden impression.  No! So can I do what I was gonna do without ban?  No, but if I'm crushing you, I will ban you for.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15185,I promise it's not an impression.  Whatever you do, I will ban you for.  Oh, fuck. Okay, then, Mooten.  Nope. Guys, sorry. It's not happening.  Oh, if you're gonna do Skype, that's fine.  Okay.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15226,Chad, are they more than bombs?  What are you doing?  Entertaining your chat while you're gone, man.  Why do you not jamming?  They're not jamming.  They hate you.  You're not wrong about what you are wrong.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15248,Like, they are jamming, but they do hate me.  How many of them hate you?  One's in chat if you hate licking.  Yeah, here we go.  One's in chat if you want to lick licking.  What? You can't do the same one, dude.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15274,Can we talk for one minute?  I want to actually mauled.  I want to mauled for a second.  Fuck this generation of kids  that literally gets fucking three or four months off school.  I would have been a pro-Starcraft 2 player.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15288,I was, but I would have been like a champion.  If I would have had fucking four extra months  to grind IC cop on fucking brute war,  I would be so fucking good.  Oh my god. Holy shit.  How good?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15302,So good.  Fuck a B minus.  I would have been A plus.  Was there S on IC cup or did it only go to A plus?  I think A plus was the highest. I might have been S plus.  I don't remember.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15315,No one has school canceled.  What are you talking about?  Nathan is, I think Nathan's school got canceled until summer break.  My roommate's kid's school was basically canceled.  Like he's doing some packets of info,  but I mean, let's be fucking real.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15326,He's doing jack shit all day.  Oh wait, see your name, Ray?  Hold on.  No, he's upstairs.  My ruin Skype character would have been fucking 99 range,  99 strength.  99.  They should go to school for an extra year.  True.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15347,I'm actually curious if there are schools that are going to do that.  It's really interesting like how they're going to handle that shit,  but I don't know how to really like this is half a school year,  basically gone and what they're going to say like,
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15360,oh yeah, they did their fucking homework packets and they're good to go.  No.  I think for the sake of what it would take,  like the toll it would hold on the school system itself,  they'll probably will pass them, but you know,
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15374,I don't know about you guys, but my school is pretty fucking stickler.  If you missed a couple weeks because of snow days and shit.  Yeah, you'd have to go a little bit longer.  Dude, there's some big fucking guys fighting there.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15393,Me and some random I fucker waiting for our turn in the goo,  like somebody destroyed the student response.  Hold on optics is undefeated into those punching matches.  He says, you've never seen me in there and he's like,  this is you in there.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15403,I'm poor man.  Is that edited?  No, it's like I said come.  What do you?  I'm just fighting.  Oh, wait, oh, what?  I don't know if you call them midgets or small people or what.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15424,I don't know what the fuck you're supposed to call them.  Little people.  But they're not little people.  A girl that's four, like 11 is a little person.  Like somebody with dwarfism or whatever is not.  Yeah, guys, they're not little people.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15438,Steve's a little person.  He knows his kind.  Drew, look at his head.  Yeah, it feels like Lucas is.  Lucas always feels like to me that he's maybe gaslighting the campaign a little bit.  Like either to like I think he's got something against me or something.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15454,I don't really know what's going on, but like I don't think he likes me in the campaign  and would rather be in it himself or something.  And I'm fine.  I mean, I don't know if it doesn't work out and they don't want me in the campaign.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15460,That's fine too.  I don't know what's with that.  Middle Middle.  He says a lot of negative stuff in chat and stuff.  The meta-mooten callouts.  We need all moderated debate between the meta-mooten and Devin.  I'll do it, guys.  Dude, one of the most uncomfortable conversations you've ever had was the one with Devin
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15482,about his D&D style.  Like when he came into chat and talked to you about it.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15513,I don't hate him or anything.  I just get triggered when people don't use their fucking spells and play the characters.  Fuck you, Destiny, respond to like it.  What did like and say?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15533,Fuck.  I was typing.  I totally wasn't listening.  I'm sorry, say it again.  It's fine.  I said that one of the most uncomfortable conversations you've had was when Devin came in and you  talked about not like the playstyle.  Oh, yeah.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15552,You also got mega-guilted into staying because the campaign was going to implode otherwise.  Mega-guil into staying and paying.  Oh, yeah.  And you pay.  That was early on.  Is it only you and Zizar and you pay?  Yes.  Oh, that's because we get the rights to stream it.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15571,To stream it, yeah.  All the money we make on those 2000, 1500 concurrent view D&D streams.  We're getting on the streamer drama.  I don't even want to be in on any fucking streamer drama.  I just get pissed from a D&D perspective when people don't use their spells.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15590,It triggered me.  Acting like you're not doing it for clout.  It triggers me in the current fucking campaign and it triggers me watching  emperors of Arcadia.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15611,Chat, why is the song sound playing?  How do you get guilt tripped into this and you pay for it?  Remember when I said I let people walk over me sometimes?  Okay, just calm down.  Can you publicly say, Coi was right?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15622,Uh, what?  Coi was right about what?  Rate.  Rate?  Yeah, usually $200 to $300 per episode.  Oh, damn.  Yeah.  Oh, we don't fuck around.  I don't.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15650,How triggered do you when Devlin was criticizing you for being ranged?  Does he charge you fee for canceling?  He doesn't, but I told him he should.  He should.  He charge half of half of half the time or whatever.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15662,Or make the person that cancels before.  It's very generous of him that he doesn't.  True.  He's just yelling at probably over 10k, but they've got like four really  fucking famous people in it.  Who, her toast, Michael Reeves?  Yeah.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15681,And one of those.  I don't think the sikuno guys is famous, but her Michael Reeves and  toast are all in huge.  Huge.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15702,What are these goddamn fucking flops?  I'm getting sick and tired of this shit.  Moot.  I'm losing money.  I'm only at 5k.  I don't care.  I'm gonna take this one down.  Yeah, give me your chance.  Game?  That was a perfect flop, I guess.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15719,Show me!  Chips!  I just don't think this is the hand to ship.  I'm shipping it.  Moot.  You'll find that in chips.  Why do you need to ship it, dog?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15740,Just to show that I got a big fucking dick at this table so  people stop bullying me.  We'll see what happens.  Sometimes you get to show them.  Dad, people need you. They need you, Dad.  I just don't know, guys.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15753,Mr. Minh is quite ahead.  I'm super far ahead. I'm like double this.  You're right. I can do this.  Oh no, someone called me. I got a sweet ten.  I can't believe I got a sweet ten.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15775,How old do you have to be?  Wait, where's Dan bring Dan?  I don't know, he's on.  How old do you have to be to where you're like scared that if you fall, you're going to die?  What age does that start?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15784,In the 50s.  No, fuck off. That's like 60s.  Okay.  Maybe 70s. Like even then, like nowadays 60 year olds, dude,  the fucking on top of shit, man. Doing CrossFit and whatnot.  You're real sad you couldn't play Nevis. It's the shy insecure one like you originally wanted.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15802,Well, listen, every campaign that I'm in, when I say to people I'm going to take a backseat role,  it ends up with either people get mad at me for not taking a leadership role or I end up having a leadership role.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15812,There's no one will do anything.  That's why we're going to do two brothers chat.  So we can both be leaders and argue the entire fucking time.  Can you imagine just an argument episode? Beautiful.  Why did you bully the halflings? Nevis is a halfling rogue that is incredibly capable.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15834,Okay. People looking down on him for being a halfling or seeing those little fucking halfling support groups for shit or halflings.  The only thing they have in common with each other is that they're fucking short.  It's triggering as fuck to Nevis.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15846,Okay. He doesn't want anything to do with that bullshit.  All right, O'Bare. You want to double through me? You want to double up, dog?  Here I am. Here I am, boy. This is your shot.  Let's fucking go. Let's fucking go, kid. Show me what you fucking piece of shit.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15859,Oh, you are shit. You're shit. You're shit. No queen. No queen.  Gimme damn chips. Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme damn chips.  Gimme damn chips, baby.  Fuck yeah. Gimme your thing. Gimme your thing. You can draw a thing really fucking good.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15872,Yes, he would have been. God damn. Put them chips in my hand.  If you don't, then you know.  Chat, I'm raising 7.25.  Destiny always plays an independent leader who hates royals and has high moral standards.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15893,That is not true at all, firstly. Okay.  The sorcerer that I played in one of the hardcore things you did was definitely mal-line.  It was quite insidious.  Kumo was definitely not a morally upright person.  Lock was...  Kumo killed a child in front of his...
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15913,Nevitz is kind of ambiguous.  What are their categories? I think I only had like four characters, right?  Lock Nevitz. Kumo.  Yeah. And then my sorcerer guy. I don't remember what his name was.  Drakven.  I gave it a super, super evil.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15931,What kind of character...  Oh, Wander. Wander was just like a play... like a faceless character.  Who's Wander? I don't know. I played it all.  Oh, that was... here was graveyard.  Fuckin'! I get the Kino flops now, dude.  All these flops are mine. I've never gotten flops this good before.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15946,Okay. Oh shit, nevermind.  I'll see you at the final table, Steve.  Lops to me. Will you?  Was directoring in the campaign with Kaelin?  Wish me luck, guys.  Good luck.  Please no bullshit. Please no bullshit. Please no bullshit.  Good luck, Ace.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15962,How did he win? What did he get? He got a bigger two pair. God damn it.  Damn.  What a fucking lockback. I flocked two pair and I lost the fucking hand.  Oh my god. No.  Did he get a fucking straight?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15978,Oh, wait. What did this guy...  I don't even know. Oh, I'm fucking triggered.  What? He had Ace Queen... Oh my god. It was an eight to queen.  Oh my god. He run or run or that fucking straight.  Oh, how disgusting.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,15999,So dirty.  So disgusting.  Do you remember that?  Maybe episode two or Neil,  because we're Sean.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16025,I'm done. Fuck poker.  Fuck this spot.  Have a good night, guys.  No, fuck you.  I'm just going to...  Bye, guys.  Leo, the up-dice in men campaign needs a tank. I could never come back as barbo.  Wait, is he in your chat?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16042,This barbo? Wait, what?  Did you just say Neil? No, no, no.  No, sorry.  Corvary doesn't come to my chat.  Sadly.  Watching their plays make really poor decisions really frustrating.  You make a good leader whether you want to be one or not.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16060,Well, the only thing about being a good leader is the thing is that people don't want to take responsibility  for bad decisions.  That's literally the only reason why more people don't step into leadership roles,  because they're really scared about being in charge of shit goes wrong.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16069,I don't give a fuck.  If shit goes wrong and we die, fuck it.  Roll another goddamn character. Yeah, at least we made a decision.  In decision is the worst decision.  Did you ever...  Did you ever watch this?  Oh, fuck.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16089,No, I wish I would have.  I don't even remember the blackface guy.  I don't know if that counts as a blackface or not.  No, no, wait. I think this is Photoshop, I think.  No, no, it is.  But you mean Heroes, maybe?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16100,Yeah, I mean, like, oh my god, dude.  Caitlyn got...  No, I wish I would have.  Corvary was like, the city is beginning to overflow with enemy goblins.  Like, from all sides, everyone in it and she's like, I'm going to run out of the city.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16110,And we're like, he's like, are you sure?  There's like 20 million fucking each other.  I'm just going to run.  Oh, man.  Did she actually cry or no?  I'm not talking shit on other streamers, but maybe.  Oh.  It's on the D&D slash whatever YouTube and yes, you cry on stream afterwards.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16141,Wait, who, Lily? No, no, no, no.  Her name's Caitlyn.  Neil banned Goodberries because of that, right?  Oh my god, yeah.  There are two camps in place from experience one.  People who want the same character the entire time and two.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16160,People who are down with character dust.  I mean, I don't want my character to die, but I'd be like, if it happens, fuck it.  If it happens, you can roll another one.  I hate the... I hate the queer with Nerf, all the good shit, though.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16171,I'm pretty sure he nerfed the pullarm shit.  Oh, good.  No, that shit was dumb.  You were so mad.  All right, let's fight.  Well, 10 feet within me.  Oh, I hit you, your speed zero.  My turn. Attack, attack, attack, attack, attack, roll, dice, roll, superior.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16189,That was incredibly stupid.  You just got one shot.  If we roll characters, two brothers, can we be like, beginning you for us?  Are you out?  Why would I be out? I'm a god.  I'm a poker guy. I'm kid poker over here.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16209,That's it.  Rope. See you guys next week.  Wait, wait.  That's it. Rope.  See you guys next week.  Except for a new clip.  All right.  What did you say, Moot? I'm listening now.  Oh, still look like.  If we'd roll a two person, it's going to be too easy.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16226,Maybe. I would have to start reading all the rules and shit for it.  It's pretty much the same.  It's just like a different shit when you level up and new spells.  It's not too much.  Are other classes good or do I need to be a fighter again?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16245,Other classes are very good.  I think the dream would be...  Cleric and Wizard seems really fucking good.  Oh, that'd be cute.  Spellcasters are incredibly fucking good into me.  Are you about two E spells?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16271,Oh, I argued about solips in for like three hours that I on stream.  Yeah, that was good.  Way to go. Dummy, dum, dum.  Dummy, dum, dum.  That's what they call the moody.  Dummy, dum, dum.  People kept arguing.  They're like, well, no.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16282,If you have an umbrella, the water is just going to go through.  The water is going to stay on the top, but it makes solips.  It's just incredibly fucking broken.  No, the water would just go through.  I was correct.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16296,No, I asked Neil.  He said that water will stay.  No, it won't.  I know it won't.  I can prove you wrong later.  Hold on.  Should I call guys?  Oh, I'm King Jack suited.  It seems like a good spot to ship, but I'm not going to.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16311,You won't destroy me.  I'll destroy you on this debate.  Here's the thing.  You're an in a literal rock slide avalanche, and then you cast a giant bridge on top of  you that you totally believe in, but then no one else does.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16323,Why would the rocks interact with that bridge?  The rocks don't have to believe in the bridge.  They have no belief in it.  They would just go right through and kill you.  Maybe you'd be able to walk in the bridge because you believe that it exists, but the bridge
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16332,wouldn't interact with every other thing like it's real, only with the things that believe  in it, and rocks don't believe in bridges.  What Koibu said is that if I believe that the bridge, if I believe that the umbrella is
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16344,there, then for me, the water will not go through.  I don't believe it.  It's no way.  It can't be true.  Otherwise, that would be so incredibly broken.  You could really just summon that.  Why do you just remove the spell?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16355,Well, no, he should.  It only stops rain for those.  My interpretation is probably close to the rules it's written, and it's a better interpretation.  So fuck.  It only stops the rain for those that believed is there, which splits reality into two camps.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16366,No, that's dumb.  The umbrella should be there.  You should be able to touch it and interact with it, but it won't stop any rain because  the rain itself doesn't believe in the umbrella.  It just passes through.  Yeah, but can rain believe?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16376,No, it can't.  That's why it would just pass through.  Can rain disbelieve?  It doesn't have.  It's like an osteic.  You don't have to disbelieve it.  You have to believe it for it to be real.  The assumed position is it's not real.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16386,That's like explicitly stated rules as written for the spell.  Well, I'm correct because Koibu said I'm correct.  So bring Koibu on and I'll debate him.  I will bring him on.  Bring him on.  Message him.  Get him in here.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16396,Koibu, can you please join Discord for a minute?  I love you.  Unless you're busy.  Careful.  I don't know why I said careful.  I don't know why the fuck I'm calling.  Server setting.  Roll members.  Koibu.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16416,Yep, he's got notable.  I hope he joins.  He'll be destroyed on the intellectual playing field.  Harder than he's ever been destroyed before.  Alright guys, how hard do we want to mean here?  If this guy had a good ace, I feel like he would have shipped it earlier.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16430,I have ace 5.  Should I just fucking go?  Does he have ace jagger, ace queen?  He's got an ace with a bigger kicker.  Fuck it.  Oh my god.  Please note 10.  No king, no jack.  Oh, he's so lucky.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16441,How am I getting sucked out on him?  Well, 49th, we tried.  49th?  49th, oh my god.  Canute still in.  You lost a canoe.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16463,Where's Koibu?  Bring him in.  Hey buddy, this is celebrity and I'm asking everyone to please stay home during this crisis.  I'm home, I'm on my rollercoaster in my backyard.  And my wife maybe is in the room.  This is loud.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16483,So we're both here.  And we have another chef with us who asked to go home.  And I said no!  I'm going to hit the beat.  Anyway, anyway, what's this shit about?  Okay, Koibu, listen to me.  Listen to my arguments, okay?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16501,This spell called solipsism, right?  Fuck solipsism.  Okay, no, no, no, I think solipsism is a good spell.  I think it's a good spell, but this is what has to be taken into account, okay?  Other physical inanimate object, okay.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16512,The default position on something summoned with solipsism is that it doesn't exist.  It requires somebody to have a belief in said thing to exist.  So inanimate objects will never interact with that summoned thing.  So for instance, if I summon an umbrella, I might see one and I can even touch it and feel it.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16526,But if I put it above my head, the raindrops will fall through it.  The raindrops don't believe in the umbrella.  So they should just pass right through.  I might believe it's there and I might be able to touch it and maybe even walk on it if I would have put it on the ground.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16537,But if I were to throw a rock at it, it should fall through because rocks do not believe much the same way that if I summoned a giant  and I believe that giant is real, maybe it could punch me and do damage to me, but it couldn't pick up another object and move it
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16548,because that object would have to profess a belief in the giant in order for it to be moved.  That's my position on solipsism, auto-word.  So how does your sword interact with the giant when your sword doesn't believe that giant exists?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16558,The sword, you would strike it and you would feel the strike.  But sword doesn't believe the giant.  But you would be holding it into your body and your body would feel that it exists.  So, but the sword, Stephen, the sword doesn't believe.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16568,Your clothes will get wet.  What if you shoot an arrow at it?  Your arrow doesn't believe.  True.  Then you know what, then those things would just pass through it.  So it would have to be a magic sword?  It's dumb.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16578,That's all I have to say.  It would just pass through it.  Fuck, boy, though.  He's wrong.  You know what?  I'm gonna say it.  Devin was right.  Shit, damn.  Get him out of here.  I am exclusively, I am scaling into, I'm gonna take all of our money in of dice and, or of, yeah, dice.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16595,I'm gonna steal it.  I'm gonna buy the solipsism of skillbook and I'm gonna learn it.  I'm gonna cast it every goddamn day.  And then I'm gonna learn how to use a bow and I'm gonna drop shot every fucking fight.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16604,That's what I'm gonna do.  Oh, I told you you get mentally fucking dumb and destroyed by him.  Why do you even bring him in?  Oh my God.  We're gonna create the most broken.  You know what we're gonna do?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16617,Do you know what we're gonna do from now on?  We're gonna take over this fucking worm.  Hold on.  Let me, let me, let me, let me check Lenny real quick.  I think there's some dumb, this is what we're gonna do with the next fight.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16627,Okay.  Are you ready?  Yeah, what?  Hold on.  Yes, quite a bit of ban my spell because it's too good.  I have something called Halfling Nimbleness that says you can move through the space of any creature that,  oh, you're not a size larger than me though.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16645,We're both medium or whatever, right?  Or small?  Yeah, I'm medium.  Are you small or are you medium?  Wait, no, Halflings must be the same size, no?  Wait, are Halfling small?  I don't know.  Okay, here's what we're gonna do, okay?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16659,We're gonna infinitely kill ranged people by both of us are gonna be prone.  You're gonna be in front of me taking the dodge action.  So you're gonna be prone.  I'm gonna be behind you with full cover.  I'm gonna crawl in front of you to take a shot with my bow and crawl behind you
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16673,because I can move through you with my Halfling Nimbleness every fucking time.  People have to shoot, they can only hit you.  You never have a bow.  And every eye do.  And every shot's gonna be taken at disadvantage with, and if they shoot at me,
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16684,it's at disadvantage and with full cover.  We're gonna be like, we're just gonna patrol the lands, going prone,  crawling through Arcadia.  Why, I threw the fucking ground.  Drop-shotting everybody.  That's what we're gonna be doing, okay?  Fuck these.  I don't wanna do this because Koi-Fi is gonna like,
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16699,he's gonna see, there's gonna be some gnolls and they're gonna see this.  And then later in a future campaign, we're gonna have drop-shotting gnolls who are  proning through the fucking ground shooting at us.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16720,If we both die in a vice-a-man, we're gonna re-roll all Archer characters around.  Every character I make from now on is already a ranged fighter.  Did you ever play Runescape?  No.  So the funniest thing to do in Runescape, if you had two bows,
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16733,it's called one-shot special, a magic-shot bows.  What you would do is you would shoot once and then you'd do a special right after,  so it'd be like three shots right in a row.  So if two Rangers were running in from the wildy and you see a dude,
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16743,you could basically both, you'd be like, all right, we're gonna one-shot spec,  you both shoot them, you both spec, and it's six points of damage.  Magic-shot-bow can be huge damage, you can drop somebody instantly.  Imagine having like four Rangers or four fighters that are archers,
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16754,that have action surge and fucking superiority dice,  and all of you would be like, fuck-shot.  Oh shit, never mind, never mind, never mind, never mind.  Anyway, we all agree that Sentinel was super broken, right?  Yes, I don't know what's fucking...
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16770,Barbo shouldn't have lost that fight-chat, just to heads up.  Barbo holds that deep within himself and is upset by it.  Okay, are you ready to go back?  I'm still in the tournament.  Oh.  I just got moved to Blamos' table, I'm gonna ship it.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16792,I don't even know what I have, I'm just gonna ship it.  Oh my god, I don't know what I got, but I'm shipping it.  I'm shipping it. Blind hand.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16813,Everyone's scared of me.  The table shipper.  Destiny Argyz with single player, I'm fucking sure he does.  Again, it's a very conservative position.  If you think universe of healthcare shouldn't be a thing you are a conservative.  Imagine trying to talk about politics and not knowing that there's been universal healthcare and single-payer.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16832,I know that she's gonna look it up now, but I guarantee you she probably didn't before.  If somebody brings it up, she'll search for it, you'll be like,  oh yeah, well obviously there's a difference.  Guarantee you, she doesn't.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16844,Get me away from these goddamn socialists.  Why would you call with force?  Why would you?  Did I tell you, Blamos?  Go all in, Blamos.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16867,Wait, is Casey in band?  Loonoon is doing ultra nightmare?  Oh, I saw him beat it.  He beat the game on some difficulty.  Nightmare, I think.  He can't do ultra nightmare.  He's not a god gamer.  Oh my god, he's trying ultra nightmare.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16884,Moon Moon's not a god gamer.  Oh, he's like a little bit farther ahead of me right now, right?  Or is this a totally different level?  Give me my fucking armor back, bitch.  No, he's in level one.  What?  No, this is level two, dumbass.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16904,That is level one.  He gets 69 gifted subs, everything he dies.  Holy shit.  What the fuck?  Oh my god, I won.  I didn't even see Chad.  I won that hand.  That took Blamos to fuck out.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16925,I'm at 23K.  I can win this thing.  I don't think I like that.  I can't even play this thing.  Oh, shit.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16947,Wait, maybe that is really good, actually.  I don't know.  Are those cat eyes?  Wait, what does that thing do?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,16967,I'm trying not to play 5e anymore.  I'm trying to play 2e.  I'm a 2e simp, it's true.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17007,Wait, what did you say?  I said it's that Afrobot and Hassan's favorite edition.  Wait, what?  Speak up.  Is that Afrobot and Hassan's favorite edition?  Is that why you like it so much?  I heard you the first few times.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17029,You fucking moron.  I just wanted to say it a third time.  I like you stutter for your insult.  I'm trying to get the insult on your mouth.  Especially when you're making fun of repeating something.  You're unintentional.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17051,You're so mad.  He's screaming.  He's going to get a noise complaint and kicked out during Corona.  He's going to get a noise complaint.  What did you say?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17072,You're microzorbotic Dan.  Look at his head.  Cringe, bro.  Good one, Steve.  Type I if Kobi came in and mentally dominated Steven on the  last one.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17094,Live pictures.  What are you doing?  What are you memeing about?  Click in your position.  What are you at?  I don't know how.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17116,I'm not going to win.  No one calls me.  We said dumbass cat.  It's triggering me.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17136,There's no cat.  I'm not a furry.  It's from Sonic.  It's a big cat.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17156,You're cringe, bro.  Sorry.  I'm not a furry.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17181,I'm a furry.  You're making me cringe.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17201,Just put a ferret law into the big cat.  Ferret law is a shitty mo.  Shut it, Jacob.  I'm reading you full.  I'm not going to win.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17223,You're not going to win anything.  You're going to go out in 12th place.  I just want to go for the win.  I'm not going to win.  I'm not going to go out in 12th place.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17251,I'm not going to get them.  I'm not going to win anything.  You're going to win anything.  Don't let him win anything.  gue to gang words your game with your gang with your community nation
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17273,and which gets the gates against again rejection  so you like  could yang with cheeky and which you can  oh
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17296,uh  of  an  trust
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17321,Yeah.  Ooh.  You're the leader of the Zumr's.  You have to lead us into victory against the boomers. Thank you.  Notice chat.  Notice how  I'm first place in doom.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17341,Destroying Destiny in poker. Beat him in Hades.  I am the new Destiny.  I'm taking everything. I'm taking it all.  Destroying them in D&D. People say you can't win in D&D, but I'm winning.  No, you're definitely making a cringe.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17361,Throw up a Starcraft game with me. I'll destroy you there too.  I'll put a thousand.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17381,Destiny, you're my buddy.  What about the plus two sword you just gave away?  I got power gamed in to give me that away.  He mad.  I would not die to a lane rush. I would destroy Destiny if you tried to rush with
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17399,links.  Times I'm just been walking the puckle of the Crystal of Doom.  Zero. What's that?  Make Lenny a cleric of Bellum. I don't think Lenny has the intellect to be a fucking cleric.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17419,I'm not doing it on this game.  Barbo.  When he comes back, he will be a good bout follower of the god of badass shit.  You know Destroying would roll you in Starcraft II and chess?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17439,I would destroy Destiny in a chess match right now.  No, you wouldn't.  I'm your superior.  Do not superior to anybody in anything for any reason ever.  Oh, I'm not superior to Aslan?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17459,No, definitely. What? No.  Why would you pick that? It's the worst possible thing you could even try to be superior to.  I think it's true.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17483,Destiny is a conservative.  I don't care what he identifies as.  I don't care what he does.  I already said I would but they're never going to do it.  Stop. It's not going to happen.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17505,Oh my god. This counts as flooding.  Are you serious?  How am I supposed to keep this motherfucker cool?  Oh, it's going to be obnoxious.  It generates no heat?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17529,Wait, really?  No, it says heat plus 125 dt.  Shut the phone.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17553,Check bacon's length, does it include?  I think I'm very good at D&D.  I think I understand one of the most important things about D&D.  One of the most important things about D&D is the aspect of letting other people take the spotlight
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17571,and realizing it's not like a Mr. Mooten episode, if that makes sense.  Why are you linking my clips?  What were they even talking about?  I think I'm very good at D&D.  What other do you feel like of NBC and another character's main movie?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17595,When he is a side character, I had 21,773 chips, so I got moved to a new table.  That means I go all in to insert my fucking dominance here.  I'm going to do this to cool this building, guys.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17621,Oh, look, I reworked this last night.  First of all, we've got some smart batteries in, so they're generated a little less heat.  I built a second steam turbine.  You need to stop playing that game.  Shut up, Mooten.  Nobody does, and you've been playing it for a fucking year now.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17641,Would you do a Starcraft 1 stream?  Maybe something like Little Bob or fucking Little Bill?  He's the only person who fucking knows anything about it.  Okay, do we think that this little bit of oil...  Okay, it's not flooded right now. Okay, this is good.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17659,Make the composition challenge post already.  Give me out, please call me.  I want to go play two.  You're not going to win, please.  You're making a cringe.  Okay, I'm going to save this.  Okay, we're going to connect these two wires and everything is just going to goddamn work.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17683,Open up.  I don't want to play anymore.  I'm an only god.  Imagine being an actual only viewer.  How sad.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17703,You're sad.  No, you.  No, I'd say you.  No, you.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17725,Stream says Doom and  Yeah, I'm just winning from Moot.  I went all in, so hopefully it's fucking over.  One more hand. Thank God.  Look, Purdy, look at the programming I've got on this, okay?  Look, it automatically cycles the water through the base once it's reached 36.5 degrees
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17745,because it won't let anything through that's less than 36, I think.  Hold on.  Oh, I'm sorry.  You're the one that bleders gate on stream? Yeah.  And then look, if my batteries get too low,  if the batteries get too low, then it sends a signal here to turn off my
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17761,aquatuners as well. So the aquatuners will only work if I have sufficient charge of my battery,  which is to find us 30%.  And as long as my temperatures are okay.  They are still in the tournament?  No, I got knocked out. Why would I?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17775,He's been out for like an hour. No, I haven't been out for an hour. You're fucking idiot.  He's really bad. You don't know anything about shit.  You're fucking trash.  Everything you trash and everything you fucking do.  Find me a twitch. What do I do?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17785,Find me nothing. But if you did do anything, it'd be trash.  I'll fight you a twitch now.  Find me a twitch now. Yeah, really. What's up, what are you doing?  I don't want to play in poker.  Oh, how's it going?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17795,Fifth, sixth, subtle 26.  Nice.  So it's okay.  Hoping to win a few dollars.  I'll save it. The legendary Moot Slayer is still in.  I'm just going on. I'm trying to get out of Swingle Place.  Stop seeing them. Oh, it's not your sponsor because you can do whatever you want.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17813,But still, you should try to win. You dumb dummy.  I don't want to win.  Why? Because I don't care.  Because you're scared.  I'm not going to win. I'm not going to win.  Just like you said. You don't think you can win.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17825,I'm not solid sizing. I can win.  Wait. What's your stat?  It's like I was at 20k, but then I just wanted to go play dooms.  I've just been going all in.  Wait, what are you at? I'm six right now.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17837,Oh my god. You're just throwing.  You're too scared.  I'm only getting trash cards.  Are you up for some gaming later?  Maybe we'll see.  We're racing doom right now so you can beat it first.  Have you played it at all?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17857,No, I thought about buying it.  But people were saying you will get bored after 10 minutes.  Oh, yeah, I don't know. It depends on the kind of music.  I mean, I think it's really sick, but it depends on what kind of games you like.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17869,Ah, damn it.  What?  Normally, that first person should have run that virtualized single player.  Oh, yeah, I don't know. If you're only like multiplayer competitive, it might be really boring, I guess.  It depends.  I don't know.  Let's see. Let's see.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17884,Can't stop fucking winning as the issue, Stephen.  Yeah, we'll say about that, Mody Kakes.  It's moody booty.  Last melt set, 4,000.  Wait, I need better.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17904,I just need better coolant.  I think the water sometimes boils out.  I think water, the pollute water was at 125.  What's a better, what is a better range of temps?  What can get a little bit hotter than that?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17919,What does this thing melt at?  Please take me out.  Just accept it.  1,500.  Holy shit.  I know, wait, melting and overheating are different, isn't it?  You're going to be done stuff in your hand. I don't want people to know.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17941,I could feel the system of oil instead, maybe.  Does it have as much thermal capacity?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17964,No line of sight?  Please don't tell me glass blocks line of sight.  Wait, of course glass blocks line of sight.  I can't be these things while they're open.  Come on, someone call me.  How long have I been taking to realize everything is cool about the regolith?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,17985,How do I not do that?  Tell me how I can avoid that.  Please educate me.  I'm back all in again, Chet.  Put the rubber miners on the ceiling? How do I cool them then?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,18006,I can't stop winning, because I'm at 40k now.  Oh yeah?  Yeah, I guess I'm going to have to say in.  I'm going to build a small ledge under them for cooling.  Oh, so I would have one sticking out like this, and then one sticking out like that, basically.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,18025,I'd have two rubber miners per thing, and then I would build a ledge under here for cooling.  I would need more than two spaces, though. I'd need four, I think.  Underscore. One space is fine. If I were to build like this, and then like that, like you're saying,
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,18049,and I would have put something here, I would need a back panel here, but how would I hold the water in from leaking?  It needs to be three wide.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,18072,Look, if I put it here, I need a way to hold the water in here.  You only need a few drops on the floor. One drop of water, what stands out about falling off, that's all you need.  Oh, well then I guess they're ready to build like this. I shipped it again, Stephen.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,18088,I'm a 45. Nice. It would have to be three wide, though, because I would need a platform to build it on, I think.  I'm so lucky, then. So it would be like this, and then I'd have to drip.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,18107,So it basically would look like this, and then I'd have to drip a water here and drip a water here.  One drip of each, and then it would have to be water with a really high thermal capacity or whatever.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,18118,This would be interesting. It would certainly clear the panels faster.  My current stack was down to 28. I shipped it again, though. How many chips are you right now?  30. 30 or 30,000? 30,000. I'm 6 out of 19.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,18139,I'm 2 out of 19, actually.  They're all the guys. 51. Mr. Cash is back. I was shipping it every other fucking hand.  Yep. Me too. He's one of my brothers.  Justin, what make you set up need one tenth the cooling? Wait, why?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,18161,Wait, you don't know why? No, no.  It's a game called Oxygen, not included. It's a really dumb game.  I think I see no play. Super ultra-blind.  Because now you don't need to cool that really hot glass at all.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,18176,Wait, how would I not need to cool it at all? What do you mean?  I'd still be destroying regolith. I'm pretty sure that the dropped items still transfer heat to the floor.  Right?  And also, it would still be on the glass for a little bit. Like, it would be shorter half the time because I'd have twice as many.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,18193,Not in a vacuum?  Wait, does this not transfer heat to this at all? In a vacuum? If this is touching that?  Oh, so I would just be destroying it twice as fast, basically.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,18214,Wait, shouldn't I make a cooling setup then that has rubble miners destroying all of it like above the bunker doors?  And then if I was destroying it above the bunker doors, then opening the bunker doors, then I wouldn't have to worry about cooling the glass at all.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,18232,This whole save is dead. I need to just start over.  This whole contraption is worthless.  You can't do that, but it's not worth redoing this setup for that. It's not that much better.  Well, what do you mean it's not that much, but I literally wouldn't have to cool almost anything.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,18252,I'm spending so much on cooling right now. Look, I have four fucking Robo tuners over here or Aqua tuners over here.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,18273,Fuck the chip leaders 101,000 almost under two. How many chips do you have? No, the chip leader number one has 101,000.  Two tables left, Modi. What's going on?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,18293,It just doesn't matter, dude. Why you can win, dude? I'm not gonna win. Why? I guess I'm not a winner. I'm a side carrier, remember?  Why is it that you have a little girl is your background? It's Annie. You know, older solos?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,18322,Hey, stop behind me. She's a thousand year old pyromancer.  Use heat for something useful, like steam or something. The problem is in order to use it for something quite useful.  Well, no, wait, I already am. I'm bringing all the hot water back here, and then I'm cooling it, and then I'm using the heat to steam turbine this ship.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,18347,Although it's not really energy positive, even remotely close to being energy positive.  Why doesn't this have line of sight, please tell me what's going on?  Do you really not? Does a telescope not see through window tiles? It should be two to the right, one, two, then five to the left, one, two, three, four, five.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,18368,The bunker tiles. See, the bunker tiles actually fuck it up.  Why do you fix it so much on underage anime characters?  What would have been fixated on an underage animal character?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,18390,The production and luxols from Talscast are liquid, or deuce, or zivy, and every cent. I don't think it opened airlocks.  Of course they won't impede visibility.  Shut up! You want to call me an idiot again? Tickets are really cheap right now. I expect that you pick your words carefully.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,18409,Check the light. I just want to use this light.  Which one is light? I don't know. Oh, this.  Full light is 61,000. Down here it's getting 54,000. It should be good.  Oh, I'm... Oh, I'm big chungus.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,18432,The fuck is happening?  It's like, why?  Can you play the button in online or not?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,18455,Play on the wall.  Can you play the button on online poker?  Doesn't that mean you put money on the button so you go last? Or I don't know what it was. See you even when now.  That's what I know.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,18491,Oh, straddle, yeah. Straddle it. There's a note.  I would destroy Destiny and fight to the death. Not that ever. I would have to fight him to the death, but I would win.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,18513,Do you have... Have you done the fight sports?  No, I have not. But I just have con...  Just say every day in my household was a fight canoe.  Feels bad.  I'm just kidding.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,18535,It's too easy. I just can't stop winning.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,18562,Well, people left. Soon it will be one table.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,18589,Not true. No, it is true.  Let's watch moody cakes.  13 players left.  I'm down to the limit.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,18729,I'm running up.  I'm down to the limit.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,18892,I'm the puzzle master.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,18914,I'm not very good at puzzles.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,18936,I'm down to the limit.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,19200,I'm not ADHD in here.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,19222,I'm down to the limit.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,20080,I can't believe it, dude.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,20102,I'm down to the limit.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,20520,There's nothing here that I need to get right now, right?
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,20542,There's nothing here.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,20564,I'm down to the limit.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,20630,This makes it look like...
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,20652,This!
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,20674,This is the limit.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,24091,This thing runs out of ammo hella fast.
GYIOTNB4bO8,20200327,24113,This is the limit.
