lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,0,And we have also alerted a variety of field and expeditionary hospitals to be prepared  to deploy as well as needed based on direction from the Commander in Chief.  Today, leadership from the Army Corps of Engineers is in New York, meeting with Governor Cuomo
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,13,and his team.  I spoke with Governor Cuomo yesterday and other governors.  I will be speaking to more in the coming days to make sure that they know what DOD can provide  through our system to address their needs.  In my conversations with governors and members of Congress about DOD's resources, I've been
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,29,made it clear that we will continue to support the  administration's comprehensive efforts and the country  every step of the way while ensuring our nation's  security remains the top priority.  I want to conclude by thanking all of our service
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,42,members and their families who have been affected  by this outbreak.  They are all great heroes.  We are continuing to support them throughout this.  We are all in this together.  Thank you all very much.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,53,Thank you.  Thank you.  So yesterday, the President made a very important  announcement about telehealth and this is allowing our 62 million seniors to be  able to get some medical services from the safety of their home reducing their  risk and without any co-pays. But we're also making sure that the health care
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,71,system is prepared and that those on the front lines have the support that they  need. The reality is the stakes are high and we need to preserve personal  protective equipment for those that are on the front lines of this fight and to
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,84,that end we have put out guidelines over the last two weeks to expand the types  of masks that can be used in routine care and saving those N95s for the most risky situations.  Conserving personal protective equipment is also essential to combat the virus.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,99,The today CMS will announce detailed recommendations to further promote this needed conservation,  specifically by limiting non-essential, elective medical and surgical procedures, including  dental procedures. We believe that these recommendations will help surgeons, patients,  and hospitals prioritize what is essential while leading the ultimate decision in the
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,124,hands of state and local health officials and those clinicians who have direct responsibility  to their patients. And we urge providers and clinicians and patients to seriously consider  these recommendations. They will not only preserve equipment, but it also allows doctors
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,140,and nurses to help those that are on the front lines.  And it will protect patients from unnecessary exposure to the virus.  We fully appreciate that this is going to have a major impact on the healthcare system,  but the shared sacrifice is essential to help those that are on the front lines.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,157,And I want to thank the medical societies such as the American College of Surgeons and  the American Dental Association that took a proactive approach and already posted these  recommendations.  And we've also talked to the American Medical Association,  and they have fully indicated their support
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,172,for this recommendation.  We now invite the entire health care community  to join us in this effort.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Robert, please.  Thank you, Mr. President.  My instructions from the President were very clear.  I was to do everything imaginable as aggressively
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,192,as possible to protect the 9 1-1-half million veterans  who are part of the Department of Veterans Affairs.  Last month, we established 19 emergency operation centers  across the country.  We began to limit the number of visitors  who entered our facilities.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,209,We began, I think, the first system to begin triaging  across the country in our 170 hospitals,  the entrance of anyone into our facility  without being questioned or tested.  We expanded those restrictions to those  in our 135 community living centers,
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,228,which have about 7,800 veterans who are in acute conditions  to make sure that they were protected.  We also took the next step and made sure that  we limited the dental surgeries that we were provided.  We've cut back by one third the number
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,248,of routine appointments we have had,  and we have canceled elective surgeries.  These were all part of the President's directive to be as  aggressive in a public health sense as we could be.  And I think we have set the pace for the entire country.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,264,I will say we've often said that we work the most noble  mission in the federal government.  Our veterans have been in the toughest spots in the world.  They have been put in conditions that are unimaginable to most  Americans, and they have responded.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,281,They have responded clearly.  They have responded with passion and also the 400,000 members of our department who  are out there on the front lines.  The last thing I will say is that you have heard a lot about the fourth mission that
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,296,VA has.  Our first three missions are health care benefits and memorial affairs.  Our fourth mission is to support the federal government in times of natural disasters and  pandemics.  We are the buttress force in case that FEMA or HHS calls upon us to deploy medical professionals
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,315,across the country to meet crises.  Wait, hold on.  Some guy in chat is, I can't tell if this guy is controlling it.  People still refer to it as the Spanish flu, they just need it to be somehow China virus
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,325,is racist, makes me wonder.  I don't know why the Spanish flu is called the Spanish flu.  I don't know if they didn't have the naming conventions for viruses that we do now.  And also Spanish is like, well, I don't know in this case,
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,339,Spanish referred broadly to like Spanish people of the Spanish country or whatnot.  But like we know what the virus is called now, right?  We have like COVID-19 is like the medical designation for it.  Corona virus is like the classification of virus.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,348,There's literally no reason to call it a Chinese virus unless you're racist.  There's just no reason for it.  I don't know when the naming conventions were.  Yeah, I don't even know if the Spanish who came from Spain or why it was called the Spanish
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,362,who have no idea.  But I do know that we have the naming conventions now  for how we name virus, Vyri, Vyri.  Yeah.  Well, we plan for that every day.  We are gaming out emergency preparedness scenarios.  And we stand ready when the president needs us
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,383,to expand our mission.  Thank you.  Thank you very much, Robert.  Thank you.  There is no reason to call this manager either  when you can call it N1H1.  Was it called N1H1 back in the early 1900s?
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,418,H1N1, I mean, and no, but you could call it that now.  I mean, I guess you could, but I don't know if people would know because usually when you say H1N1 people  There was like a recent outbreak of H1N1 that people usually associate that with
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,434,Oh, and then the swine flu was 2009  I didn't even know about viruses when Spanish was raging in.  Thank you all.  That's very nice.  Any questions, please?  Thank you.  Thank you.  Two questions, if I may.  Your Treasury Secretary was on Capitol Hill talking about the potential for what could
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,466,And he said that unemployment could skyrocket to 20%  Are we looking at that?  Just pointing out it's logically inconsistent.  I guess, I mean, I guess like if I felt like people used  Spanish flu as a way to be like derogatory towards
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,480,Spanish people, if I had that vibe, I would probably be a  lot more concerned with it.  Yeah, I mean, I guess if you have a formal name for it,  that's it's probably better to do it.  But it seems like with the Chinese virus, with the dirty
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,493,Chinam and eating rats and bats in the markets, like I've  heard a lot more racially charged language being used  about the Chinese virus.  It's a way different tone than the Spanish flu.  What about Wuhan coronavirus?  I think that's okay.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,513,I've heard some people say the coronavirus in China  or the Wuhan coronavirus or whatever,  is a little bit better than the Chinese virus.  Thank you.  Right.  Well, I don't agree with that.  No, I don't agree with that.  No, I don't agree.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,525,That's a absolute total worst case scenario.  But no, we don't look at that at all.  Thank you.  No, wait a minute.  Why do you keep calling this the Chinese virus?  There are reports of dozens of incidents of bias against Chinese Americans in this country.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,533,Your own aid secretary says he does not use this term.  He says ethnicity does not cause the virus.  Why do you keep using this?  It's not racist at all.  No, no, no.  It comes from China.  That's why.  It comes from China.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,543,What do you have here?  Yeah, it's done.  It's behind you.  I have a great love for all of the people from our country, but as you know China tried  to say at one point, maybe this stuff now, that it was caused by American soldiers.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,556,That can't happen.  It's not going to happen.  Not as long as I'm president.  It comes from China.  China.  Two questions like Mr. President, first of all, on the defensive procurement act.  Yeah, so it sounds like it's like a nationalistic, also a nationalistic instead of xenophobic
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,567,or racist, but there are also Chinese people in the United States today whose businesses  are being harmed because people don't want to eat Chinese food because they think that  the Chinese virus is going to come from them.  We have to take a look at the
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,577,agenda.  On the floor a short time ago, the  urgently needs to be put into  action to produce medical supplies,  particularly ventilators.  Do you have some targets that you  would like to see immediately  spooled out of the agenda?  We do have tremendous numbers of ventilators,
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,586,but there's never been an instance like this.  No matter what you have, it's not enough.  That would be the case.  And we will be, it's being signed.  It's essentially going inside it and  just going to look well.  If we need to use it, we'll be using it at full speed ahead.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,593,He says he needs to be used.  He says he needs to be used.  He has to target.  We have to target for certain pieces of  equipment.  We have targets for masks.  them, but we need millions more.  This thing like this has never been requested, and it's never,
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,602,we've never had even think in terms of these numbers,  but we need millions of masks and all of that will be ordered.  We need respirators.  We need ventilators as a big thing because it's a complex piece  of equipment.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,608,So we have a lot of ventilators, but we're going to be ordering  one.  And that's a question.  What size will the checks be that we set out to?  To be determined.  We're working with the Senate right now.  We're working with everybody on Capitol Hill.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,615,There's been tremendous.  There really has been, I mean, with some exceptions, obviously,  because it's always the way it is.  But there has been getting on very well Republicans and Democrats.  It's a nice thing.  Very bipartisan support.  I don't want to get into that right now, John.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,623,We are looking at different numbers.  We're looking at timing that would be different, splitting the time, splitting the payments.  We're looking at a lot of different things.  It hasn't been determined yet, but it will shortly be determined.  And people want to go big, as opposed.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,630,Everybody seems to want to go big, and they want to get to the recovery.  The big thing we can do is get rid of this horrible, I call it the unseen enemy.  You call it, there's a thousand different terms to work, but it's not about us.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,638,And it did 128 countries.  I think it's in something like that very close to that.  Think of that.  So it spreads violently.  It's a very contagious, very, very contagious virus.  You're an American to be on wartime footing in terms of fighting the virus.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,647,I do.  it was a very early stopping people coming in and could be very heavily infected and it was a very good move and it was very early very early when most people  completely like professionals they didn't want us to do it, that really saved our lives and yeah, I look at it.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,658,Wasn't the United States one of the last people to start the travel restrictions?  Am I remembering my timelines incorrectly? When I was overseas I thought I heard about Europe stopping a lot of travel restrictions like Italy and stuff way before the United States did.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,670,and my understanding also, I could be wrong, but my understanding also is that the reason why Canada was delayed and announcing that they were going to restrict travel to the U.S. and Canada was because the U.S. was dragging their feet on it.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,681,That was my understanding of the recent Canadian announcements regarding travel.  They, uh, in a sense, I'm the work time president.  I mean, that's what we're fighting.  It's a, uh, it's a very tough situation.  You have to do things you have to do.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,691,W.A.A.R.R. HR, HR, HR, HR, HR, HR, HR.  We're going to defeat this enemy.  And, uh, what we're doing, and we're doing it well,  and I tell the American people it's been incredible.  Four of the most part, they've been really incredible.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,701,Yeah, please, Gabe.  I'm wondering if you can have one because I'm very well.  I'll start with you.  You just said there are a tremendous number of military  that we have, but for weeks, hospitals have been  worried about critical shortage.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,706,They say we are not the hero.  long to note that the infrastructure.  The hospital is supposed to have regulators, too.  And when we have thousands of ventilators,  it sounds like a lot, but this is a very  unforeseen thing.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,713,Nobody ever thought of these numbers.  Nobody ever saw numbers like this.  Even with regard to testing, nobody would be doing testing  and they decided to do it very, very hard to ramp up.  Now we're getting highly sophisticated tests,
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,719,and it's going very well.  But nobody's ever heard of testing and the kind of quantities  that you're talking about.  What do you believe when you need more ventilators?  Well, we do.  It depends on how it goes.  Worst case, absolutely.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,726,Best case, not at all.  So we're going to have to see where it goes.  But we are ordering thousands and thousands of ventilators.  And complex, these are complex machines.  But we're wondering, does anybody have a mic, maybe a new
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,733,new company do we have?  And we're like, yes, please, do you know the number?  We have a specific number of ventilators in the stockpile.  It's in excess of 10,000 and these are from the Department of  Defense, the other one thousand and that.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,741,But President, even this morning and yesterday afternoon speaking  of the largest company in this country, we're hearing a  tremendous spirit among industry leaders who are ready to  step in and to that volume.  The stockpiles don't count all of the ventilators that exist
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,751,today in the marketplace and in healthcare facilities around  the country.  But the President has given us a direct and to make sure that our  stockpile is just as important working with industry leaders  that we're securing the increase in ventilators, the increase in
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,758,the increase in mask gloves, eye-protected care,  garments that are all necessary to lean forward.  And we're confident we'll be able to accomplish that  with the incredible cooperation of the supply chain  that exists in America today.  The Press And the Secretary?
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,767,The President?  We can do that a second.  We're ordering a lot more.  We're ordering a lot more.  Okay, go ahead.  One second.  One second.  One second.  One second.  Thank you.  First question, Mr. President, thank you.  First question on the Canadian Board.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,779,What was the big one?  Friday, we talked about it that Monday you said no one  to answer any questions.  I said not yet.  I spoke with the Prime Minister, Mr. Trudeau.  Very good relationship, obviously, between us and our two
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,784,countries.  And no typical one.  contact because that's the way we're going to win this one. That's so important. And we both  thought it was not affecting trade. It's not essential. It's not essential crossings. It won't affect  trade at all. And it was just something we thought we'd be good for both countries.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,794,Just please.  I'll give you the trade.  I can be sure the trade and everything that's being shared from one side.  They don't get in a very careful manner. You can only be vigilant and very professional. But it's not
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,803,pretending that there's one with the trade between the two countries.  Yeah, please.  All three candidates going to die of the COVID?  For the airlines, $150 billion in loan guarantees from critical sectors of the economy.  $250 billion payment on April 6th, directly to individuals, another $250 billion payment
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,820,on May 18th, again, directly to individuals and as well, $300 billion for small business  loan guarantees.  Is that in the general sense what you're looking at?  It could be.  It could be.  And we're also playing with a lot of numbers, a lot of very big numbers and a lot of very
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,837,small numbers, frankly.  We want to take care of it.  We have to help everybody who's nobody's fault has happened.  I mean some people could say it was did you download the final fantasy 7 really hit no yes fault and certainly none of these
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,851,Wait, did he just blame China on this?  Directly to individuals wait hold on  There are two hundred fifty billion dollar payment on May 18th again directly to individuals and as well  300 billion dollars for small business loan guarantees is that in the general sense what could be it could be and we're also
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,867,Playing with a lot of numbers a lot of very big numbers and a lot of very small numbers frankly  We want to take care of it.  We have to help everybody.  It was nobody's fault.  This happened.  I mean, some people could say it was somebody's fault, actually.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,877,But it was nobody's fault.  And certainly none of these companies that all of a sudden had no passengers and planes  and had no passengers and cruise ships and all of the things that have happened.  But I will say that they can't be blamed for this.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,885,And we want to keep those companies vibrant because it's going to be a comeback very,  very quickly.  So this has solved and it will be solved.  We will win.  And it will take place very quickly.  The $50 billion there is give or take $3 million Americans or so.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,894,Just do the math lab about $750 per cent, $4 million.  That would be about $3,000 on average again, rough math.  Which is that?  I understand that because it's a moving, these are all, every number that you mentioned, yes, we talked about those numbers, we're also moving those numbers in both directions.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,903,So we'll let you know, it'll be, it's moving on fast. Again, there's a great bipartisan effort going on that I haven't really seen before to this extent.  We have the best virus folks, everyone, what is virus?  They look, it's down the line and they're looking at it very seriously. And I think it would be a great thing because the others, to use a nice word, it's very inconvenient.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,923,It's very tough.  You tweeted this morning about your approval rating amongst Republicans.  You have said that you give yourself a 10 in terms of handling this crisis.  How do you reassure Americans at home who don't trust you to handle a crisis of this
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,940,magnitude?  Well, I think we're doing a really good job.  We started off with a termination of the border, the people coming in from China where  this oil started.  That meant I took it very seriously.  When I use the word calm, calm doesn't mean that I'm not taking it seriously.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,955,Calm means, and we should be calm.  We should be extremely calm.  But yeah, 95 percent within the Republican Party and over 50 percent.  And I also have, we have very great approval numbers.  I mean, people like the job that we're doing.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,970,And when you compare this to other epidemics or if you want to use a different term,  you can.  But within this country, and you look at what's happened over the years.  This is being handled very, very professionally.  We have the greatest professionals in the world.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,985,We're doing a good job.  Nobody's ever been swamped like this.  Nothing's been so contagious.  The level of contagion has been incredible, actually.  Nobody's seen anything quite like this.  Peter, go ahead.  The Press Secretary for a second.  If federal officials have shipped millions of tests as you
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1002,and your colleagues have said why is the federal government  says of only 59,000 tests been processed to this point.  We just heard from the Atlanta Public Health Director  saying that they have fewer than 50 test kits  for more than 900,000 citizens.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1018,Where are the tests?  I'll let Mike go ahead.  Go ahead, Mike.  So that's a very critical question,  and thank you for asking.  That's not Mike.  So the test kits that we put out last week  through the approval, the rapid movement of that meeting
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1034,that President Trump called less than two weeks ago,  that has resulted in bringing our private sector  to the table because the test and the platform that was out there could only run between  four and 12 tests per platform per day.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1049,We've now moved into platforms that can run basically tens of thousands of tests per day.  So yeah, the reason I'm grateful for your question because it allows me to point out  that of course then there was backlog.  There were individuals who had been tested.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1065,Hey buddy.  have their specimen run because of the slow throughput.  It's now in a high-speed platform.  So we will see the number of people diagnosed dramatically  increase over the next four to five days.  I know some of you will use that to raise an alarm that we are
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1085,worse than Italy because of our slope of our curve.  To every American out there, it will be five to six days  worth of tests being run in 24 to 48 hours.  So our curves will not be stable until sometime next week.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1103,The reason I talked about Thermo Fisher yesterday  is because their platform is in 2,000 laboratories.  They're the ones that are putting out the million tests  this week that will solve the issue that Atlanta and others  have brought up.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1119,I wanted to be clear.  We prioritize the areas.  We do county by county analyses.  Based on those analyses on what counties had more than 50 cases, we prioritize the test  kits we put out, the 400,000.  And that's why we're seeing a 7% plus positivity rate.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1139,We'll be able to expand that platform and re-prioritize based on the accessibility of  the other kits.  Mr. President, perhaps I can follow up.  How are non-symptomatic professional athletes getting tests while others are waiting in  line. True. Can't get them. Do the well connected go to the front of the line?
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1154,Well, you'd have to ask them that question. I mean, they I've read no I  wouldn't say so but perhaps that's been the story of life that does happen on  occasion and I've noticed where some people have been tested fairly quickly.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1168,Story of life. Excuse me. We inherited a very obsolete system. This was a  a system that was out of date obsolete, or it was a system  that was never meant to take care of the kind of quantity.  The number of people that we're talking about,
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1185,millions and millions of people.  If you go back in years past, like even recently,  with the flu, nobody had tests before.  They didn't test the entire nation to see whether or not  they had flu.  They got the flu.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1198,They got better.  Hopefully they got better.  That was it.  Now, all of a sudden, they do this very complex testing.  What we've done is we've broken it down,  we've broken up the system.  But it was obsolete and or, you could say,
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1210,it was also a system that just wasn't meant to handle  the kind of volume that you're talking about.  We've rebuilt it into a system that, for the future,  will be a very good system if you want to go this route.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1220,But this was never done before, and I would imagine  it will be done in the future.  But we've built it into a very good system by using  private companies, the great private companies.  And I have to say, Roche has been doing a very good job.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1234,They're doing a lot of work, a very good job.  But this was an obsolete system.  This was not a system that was meant to do anything like this  or even near this.  John.  The President, a couple of days, a major train coalition
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1246,is calling on you to suspend tariffs with other countries  as part of the response to the coronavirus.  Who heads that group?  Those countries.  Jews.  Uh-oh.  No, it's an American free trade.  I know.  I'm sure a free trade.  Look, China's paying opinions and billions of dollars in tariffs.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1262,And there's no reason to do that.  They haven't even spoken to me about that.  China hasn't asked me to do that.  But we're getting billions of dollars a year from  tariffs, from China.  And I can't imagine Americans asking for that.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1275,But it could be that China will ask for a suspension  or something.  They'll see what happens.  China's having a very rough time.  They have their worst year and 76 years as I understand it.  They have it a very, very tough time.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1286,And then on top of it, this happened with the virus.  but no, we're taking in billions of dollars a year in tariffs.  And that's American taxes.  It was by something totally.  When he says tariffs, that means American taxes.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1298,On asylum seekers and people who cross the southern border  illegally, are you planning to invoke 42 USC 265,  which would allow you to prohibit entry of certain people?  Yes.  When will that happen?  Very soon.  Probably today.  Yes.  I have a question for you.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1316,Any questions for Dr. Burke?  Yeah.  or their plans to fully shut the Mexican border?  And what is it for me as essential travel when it comes  to the U.S. Canadian border?  Well, I think essential is medical.  We have military working together.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1330,We have industry working together.  And again, it's not affecting trade, so things like that.  But just leisurely, let's go to a restaurant that have dinner,  which a lot of people do.  They come both ways.  They go in both directions.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1342,That kind of thing we have ended on a temporary basis.  Yeah, please.  Go ahead.  Not close it. No one ought to close it.  But we are invoking a certain provision that will allow us  great latitude as to what we do.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1357,Please.  The question was if I could.  Yeah, go ahead. You know what?  Go ahead.  Sure.  The Wall Street Journal.  Thank you.  So, turn us a clarify something because just a week ago,  you all were standing here telling us that unless you had
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1368,sustained contact with somebody who was symptomatic for  COVID-19, you really didn't need to work.  You told the President, the Vice President, that if they  shook hands with somebody who had this.  If they took a photograph with somebody who had this,
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1380,he didn't really need to worry.  And yet, several days later, at we're in a situation  where people are being told, don't leave your houses.  There are curfew saying you cannot walk alone at night  after a certain time.  Can you go walk us through what seems like
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1392,a very dramatic swing, a very dramatic disconnect  from what we were hearing before to what we're hearing now?  So two things.  We look at data all the time.  And I know you're looking at the China and South Korea data.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1403,And when you look at China and South Korea data  and you look what China and South Korea did,  you can see that their curves are not only blunted  outside of Wuhan.  Where are my games?  China and areas outside of Wuhan over it.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1419,You are in a wounded curve  and South Korea blunted curve.  If you look at their curve today,  they're already on the far end of their epidemic curve.  Of course, none of those countries are fully back to work.  And so that's what we worry about, too.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1435,Secondly, there was a series of scientific articles published,  and I know you've seen them, too, about surface contamination.  I think none of us really understood the level of surface  piece.  So we're still working out how much is it
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1449,by human-human transmission, and how much is it by surface?  And this is why those fundamental guidelines were put out  that says, don't expose yourself to surfaces outside the home.  Basically what those guidelines are is don't expose yourself to excess number of persons
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1467,who could be asymptomatic and infected and then the person to person contact.  And don't expose yourself to surfaces that could have had the virus on it for which on  hard surfaces.  I know we had the cardboard issue about shipping.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1480,Uh oh.  Hard surfaces, not shown in fabric as much or in cardboard but hard surface transmission.  These are issues that we haven't had to deal with before with the level of respiratory  infections.  And that's why we have this concern.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1493,And that's why the President put out the guidelines.  And so it's to cover both of those pieces.  That's all new science, all new models.  I think many of you have the Imperial study available and looked at the impact of those.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1506,That's the first time those have been modeled as a comprehensive approach to mitigating  an epidemic.  in Dr. Bruce yesterday.  Mr. President, the Wall Street Journal is reporting  that the administration looked at an executive order  that would expand the use of investigational drugs
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1525,against the virus, but that FDA scientists are warning  that this could put patients at risk.  Have you ever seen the article?  No, I haven't seen the article.  We will, we are making a lot of progress therapeutically.  I will say that.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1537,And, but I have not seen that article now.  We've shut down non-essential travel to Canada.  Are you considering all travel to brunt the spread of the virus?  And we've heard from industries like the airlines who are seeking relief.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1556,What other industries or what how exactly is your administration going to determine which  industries and businesses.  Well, there were certain industries that people now and the airlines would be number one.  if you look at what's going on.  They go from having the best year they've ever had
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1571,to having no passengers because of what we've had to do  in order to win this war.  It's a war.  And so, you know, basically, you know,  what many of the industries are.  What we want to do is we want to make sure they all
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1585,stay together so that after the war is won,  we can immediately go right back up to where we were  and even beyond.  I think we're going to go beyond where we were.  And a lot of people are saying that, by the way.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1594,We're poised to do that.  But we have to win the war first.  Yeah, please go ahead.  I'm trying to bring a good follow-up on that.  Treasury proposed $150 billion today for those industries,  but their proposal doesn't detail which industries
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1607,we get that money and how much.  So aside from the airlines, which you just mentioned,  what about the cruise industry, the hotels,  how much of that money do you see them each year?  We're talking about all of it.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1617,Haven't detailed it yet.  We have detailed it to senators and to members of the house.  We have been talking about it.  And we're coming up with numbers.  Haven't gotten there yet.  But certainly, the hotel industry, the cruise ship industry,
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1629,the airlines, those are all prime candidates, absolutely.  The President has been on the border border, sir.  When you say we're going to have a border border,  then we're going to have another similar pandemic  within the next decade.  I have no idea.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1642,If it does, what sort of a special problem  would we have been seeing?  No, ma'am.  Imagine everyone having to have a medical exam  before leaving, entering another country.  Millennials and others perhaps not  taking some of these warnings.  as seriously as you would like.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1657,Some of those people also seem to be your supporters  and conservatives who may be quoting some of what you said  at the beginning of this, comparing it to the flu.  What is your message to them to really follow
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1670,what you've been saying so far?  And are you concerned that they're still listening  maybe to some of your earlier comments  rather than your more recent ones?  Well, I think my earlier comments are to be calm.  I mean, I do want people to be calm
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1682,because we're gonna win this  And we're going to win it.  It's just a question of time.  And I wanted to go quickly.  So based on the fact that I wanted to go quickly,  I hope they just listened to what we've been saying
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1691,over the last period of time.  We don't want them gathering.  And I see they do gather, including on beaches  and including in restaurants, young people.  They don't realize they're feeling invincible.  I don't know if you felt invincible when you were very young,
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1706,but they were feeling totally invincible  or are feeling that way, but they don't realize  that they can be carrying lots of bad things home to a grandmother  and grandfather and even their parents.  So we want them to heed the advice.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1719,We mean the advice.  And I think it's getting through.  I do believe it's getting through, Jim.  They're watching.  They're watching.  Sorry.  I think there are a lot of them watching.  A lot of these people at home, these young people.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1729,I'm talking about scream time.  He has a lot.  He has a lot of the advice.  I just said, yeah.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Thank you, Peter.  Mr. President, I don't want anything to be done.  Mr. President, how long do you think this is going to last?
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1739,I'll get you next, okay?  Say it.  The Press.  The Press.  And talking about China, you've been very clear about who you think is to blame or where  the origins of the blame for this virus is.  Not think.  No, no.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1751,I don't think.  I know who where it came from.  I don't know if you'd say China's to blame.  Certainly we didn't get an early run on it.  It would have been helpful if we knew about it earlier.  But it comes from China.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1763,And it's not a question about that.  Nobody's questioning that.  Senator Cotton is saying that they should be punished in so many words for inflicting this on the American people.  Do you feel that way about it?  Well, I have a lot of respect for Tom Cotton, and I know exactly what he's been saying.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1780,And there were those people that say that, so we'll see you in a long time.  Go ahead, it's your turn, guys.  There's a lot of weasel.  There's been waiting a long time, please.  You've had your hand up so nicely for a long time, it's your time.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1795,We've seen the Chinese government kick out reporters from the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the Washington Post.  What is your message to the Chinese when it comes to transparency at a moment?  We still have reporters asking you questions here at the White House.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1808,I'm not happy to see it.  I have my own disputes with all three of those media groups.  I think you know that very well.  But I don't like seeing that at all.  I'm not happy about that at all.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1822,Yes, please.  You didn't correct the language.  I wonder if you agree with it.  Do you believe that China is inflicting this  upon our country?  No, I don't believe they're inflicting.  I think they could have given us a lot earlier notice.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1832,Absolutely.  Please.  Go ahead.  Please.  Yeah.  Mr. President, your credibility ratings are very low.  There's a recent NPR poll.  Will you ask?  There's a lot of people saying that you should supply.  I've seen that they're very high.  Lots of people saying that.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1847,You know, 95% of the Republican Party.  We just had a poll that was done by a very reputable group  where I'm beating Sleepy Joe Biden by a lot in Florida,  the state of Florida, and in other states.  You know, so I don't really know who you're talking about.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1865,Jennifer, go ahead, please.  Please.  The question is either willing, sir.  Would you put this up to you on your conversation  with the airline executive?  Yeah.  Did you explain to them what's coming?  What was their reaction?  And they explained to me where they're coming from.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1877,And they went from, as I said, full planes packed the best  year they've ever had by far to boom, one day empty because  of what we have to do to get rid of, to win this war.  Or we would have a level of death like people haven't
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1894,seen before.  So they've been fantastic.  I mean, they've been great.  But, you know, they went from being extremely happy to  being people that are running companies that are going  to need some help.  And we'll help them, Jennifer.  The Press, the President on SBA loans.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1910,Would you be willing to give us an update on how that's going?  We've been getting some reports that counties have been  having a significant amount of time.  The President.  Well, it's going.  I mean, there's a lot of influx to those loans,
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1920,as you could imagine.  A lot of people are looking at it,  but we're going to be increasing funding a lot.  They're very well prepared to do what they have to do.  And the SBA is doing a fantastic job.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1929,She is doing a really good job, the Administrator.  John.  The Press, Secretary of the President,  a couple of questions for Dr. Bursts.  Yeah.  If I could.  Dr. Birk, French researchers have had some  blood with hydroxychloroquine.  In shortening the duration of disease,
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1944,is that something that might be in the arsenal of therapeutics  here in the United States?  I think we are exploring every one of those issues.  The President asked for a critical briefing on that today.  He opened with that.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1956,It is more than that single drug.  There are other drugs that individuals are looking at.  Just to go back to what we have talked about many times,  there is things that look really good in cell culture  against the virus that may look good in small animals
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1972,and then don't have an impact in humans.  And so those are the pieces that we're looking at  very carefully.  Of course, there's always anecdotal reports  and we're trying to figure out how many  anecdotal reports equal real scientific breakthroughs.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,1986,Anacodalists, she said.  Are you confident of the seasonality of coronavirus?  All we can do is look at the past to inform the future.  We know what SARS looked like.  We also know, and I just want to put this out, I know you can get it online, look at
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2003,the curve in China and look at the curve in South Korea.  Those curves were accomplished in still the winter season.  And so we're trying to understand what those relationships are.  We're very interested in the curves in Italy because they're a different approach and we're
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2021,are following every single country's curves.  And so all we can do is look at prior coronavirus  and prior respiratory infection RNA viruses.  These are RNA viruses.  When you look at flu in the Northern Hemisphere,  when you look at paranfluenza and some
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2039,of the other cold viruses, and if you look at SARS,  that's the way the peak normally occurs.  But that is a November to April.  We all started later.  And so you're asking me to predict based on a later start.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2055,And that's what we're trying to really look at China  and South Korea to really inform them.  The Press's question for Secretary Wilke, if you don't mind,  or you can answer it if you'd like.  How many veterans of those that need to be tested
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2068,have been tested?  Those that have needed to be tested,  we believe we've caught most of them.  Right now, we have 44 veterans who have tested positive.  Sadly, one has passed in Portland.  We are working with state labs and private companies to make
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2088,sure that testing is available.  Because the President had us out aggressively early,  we have been in a better place than most health care systems  in the country.  I cannot predict, as Dr. Birx said,  when the next surge will be, if it will be.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2107,But one of the things that we do at VA  is that we prepare for national emergencies,  be the national disasters or epidemics.  We started preparing for this.  We started stockpiling equipment.  Our equipment is stable.  And I think that's in large part
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2124,because the instructions the President gave me.  The Press Secretary- The President- The President- The President-  The President- The President- The President- The President-  The President- The President- The President- The President-  I can't give you the direct.  Yeah, we've tested several hundred.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2135,Yes, we've tested several hundred.  I don't know exactly.  I do know that 44 veterans have the virus.  Most of those are quarantined at home.  Go ahead, the back.  Thank you, Mr. President.  The question for Dr. Burbs quickly.  I'm trying to understand what we,
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2155,it's about the mortality rate.  Yesterday, we underlined the fact that we had reached  100 deaths and this morning we wake up and we're at 110  Within 12 hours we we climb by 10 percent. Is it something we have to expect from now on?
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2173,Increase  Question of this one so very early on in each one of these cases if you look at all of the countries to date  The mortality is higher at the beginning because you're diagnosing the sickest  the ones who came in quite ill.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2188,And I just want to remind the American public  that still the majority, the risk for serious illness  and the majority of Americans are low.  But that doesn't mean that you can't transmit it  to one of those higher risk groups.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2202,And that's why we're asking for all Americans  to take responsibility.  You're seeing mortality or deaths today  from infections that occurred two to three weeks ago,  in general.  The other thing that you're seeing is the dramatic and very  difficult impact of this virus in nursing homes.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2221,And that's why very early on, the President and Vice  President had us come out and CMS put those very strict  rules in place.  And everybody thought we were being too strict and keeping  loved ones away from their family at nursing homes.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2235,If we're going to solve this with a lower death rate,  we have to protect the elderly because of their  percent is much higher in mortality than any other age group.  Okay. Go ahead, please.  Mr. President, there's federal, there's reporting that the federal government has a plan that
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2254,shows that this coronavirus outbreak might last as long as 18 months.  Are you seeing those numbers?  Could it be a disaster?  No, we're not seeing the video.  And then the second question is, there are some, at least one White House official who
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2265,used the term Kung flu referring to the fact that this virus started in China.  Is that acceptable?  Is it wrong?  Are you worried that having this virus be talked about  as a Chinese virus that might not be full of kids?
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2279,You know who said that?  I'm not sure of the person's name,  but would you condition the fact that the person-  Say the time again.  A person at the White House used a term-  It's just a tongue flu.  My question is, do you think that's wrong?
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2291,Kung flu.  And do you think using the term Chinese virus  that puts Asian Americans at risk  that people might target that?  No, no, no, no, no.  I think they probably would agree with it 100%.  It comes from China.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2304,There's nothing not to agree.  OK, how about last question?  Please go ahead.  You're very publicly saying it.  Switching gears to a larger question here.  We've seen that before the pandemic,  there were a lot of Americans that were already alienated.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2317,We saw deaths of despair increasing  through suicide and other things.  Now is these individuals.  A lot of times, as rural parts of the country,  are self-isolating.  What is your message to those individuals?  And what do you hope that individuals, communities,
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2330,and churches will do to return to them?  My message is to all Americans,  but to those Americans who are going through a lot,  we love them, we're with them,  and we will not let them down.  Thank you all very much.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2340,President Trump.  President Trump.  President Trump.  President Trump.  President Trump.  President Trump.  Nice.  Good one, guys.  How are we doing this?  Wonderful morning.  That's the answer.  Destiny says once you talk to your corona hoax video, he has my number.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2367,Wait.  Mr. Rank, do I?
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2398,Do you talked in Google Hangouts before?  Um, yeah, I'm just trying to remember.  It was at Google Hangouts.  Why did the ninja go to the doctor?  He had the kung flu.  Why, um, if we turn on Google Hangouts, how the fuck does that mean I have anything?
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2426,intention meet  have  I'm scared.  Hatchoo.  Do you ever play this fire against Abnodica?
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2457,Yeah, I've played it for a bit.  I've played it for a decent amount of time.  I got it on board.  About subnautica below zero?
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2488,No.  Why is Skype not opening?  What is it under services?  Why don't I see Sky... I can't. My Sky is fucked.  Pro tip, if you want to find out how extreme an insular someone's political views are just.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2521,Ask for their opinion on the BBC.  Oh wait.  Pfft!  Coronavirus video was wondering if you wanted to chat about it.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2556,Okay, I fired off the email.  It's okay.  Is there anything else you can do with polluted dirt that doesn't require manual interaction  with the duplicants?  Like I don't want to have to make my people actually go and fucking shovel compost.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2585,There's no way that I can automatically do this.  Like it looks like it...  Dissolves on its own or whatever.  It takes a long fucking time  You can make a poke shelf on fuck that what are those guys even give you I don't need that
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2599,Also, what I was funny goddamn pips. I hate these motherfuckers. They don't do shit for me  They just run around my base and look stupid, but for some reason they're breeding like fucking rats  Christ aren't they supposed to die? What are these guys even fucking eat?
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2611,Subsis on the branches of arbor trees. Where? There are no arbor trees on the map. Oh, there's a failure.  Whatever. Two months, pog.  POG. POG out, my dude.  What the fuck are you even cooking right now?  Cooking gristle barrel, that's gonna...
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2641,What's on the ground right now?  I'm going to try it out.  It's on quite grumps today.  Actually, I'm going to put it in today.  We'll get pretty early.  Do it now, okay.  Doin' okay.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2681,Trying to automate as much of this shit as possible so my people can work efficiently.  I have solved cooling in this fuck ass game.  Maybe too much.  Instead of fucking around trying to power the steam shit, I just hooked it right up to my main goddamn power system.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2697,LOL moment anyone else lolling LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL XD I am lolling XD XD XD  Get your lols out in chat guys.  Am I the only person that thinks that Billy Eilish is singing about like love and shit

lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2791,oh yeah holy shit did you guys see this dude posted as dissertation earlier  Advanced theoretical burning math for how burning was gonna win?  Holy shit.  We might just watch this video once per day until he finally drops out.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2810,Cause it's just so perfect.  Hey buddy.  Hey, you having trouble with your homework?  Yeah, I'm usually pretty good at math.  This just doesn't make any sense to me.  Okay.  Let me see if I can help you out.  What are you working on?
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2829,Bernie math.  Here's the problem I'm struggling with.  Hillary Clinton currently has 1,930 delegates.  Alright?  Bernie Sanders currently has 1,189 delegates.  Explain how Bernie Sanders is actually winning like the Internet says he is.  Did you remember that he's winning but the lame-stream media isn't reporting it?
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2850,No, no, I don't see that at all.  Oh, he has fewer delegates.  Okay.  Well, let's take a look at your math  and see where you went wrong.  Okay.  Yeah, I just compared the two numbers  and saw which one was bigger.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2863,Yeah, see, you skipped a bunch of steps here.  First, you have to subtract the super-dellians.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, why did you do that?  I'm not bad with me.  Then you add 10 momentum points  for every stake you want in a row.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2875,Multiply that by how much birds like him.  Now, you do have to subtract a point  for every media outlet that is blacking him out.  But even after you do that,  you can see that he's winning in a landslide.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2887,No, it feels like you're just jumping through  a bunch of hoops to mask a hard mathematical truth  that you don't like.  Could it be that you're a fucking Hillary supporter  who thinks she's entitled to presidency?  No, I'm not saying anything about the candidates themselves.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2899,I'm saying if you look at the numbers,  Hillary Clinton's delegate count is bigger.  Okay, let's look at it like this.  Okay.  California has 475 delegates, right?  Okay, yeah, I'm following you.  Okay.  Everyone I know personally is voting for Bernie Sanders.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2916,Therefore, we can assume that all 475 delegates  in California are gonna go to him.  Oh.  And there you go.  There I go, what?  No, even if he wins all 475 of those delegates,  he's still losing him.  Now you're making the same mistake.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2929,You're not subtracting the super delegates.  Yeah, so can you explain why you do that again?  I don't like them.  Okay.  They're not democratic.  Okay, oh, no, I think I get this, okay.  So that means we also don't count caucus results
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2942,because those aren't very democratic when you think about it.  No, no, no, no, no, no, we love caucuses.  If anything, caucuses count double.  I'm now confused again.  It sounds to me like you think it's impossible  from the win and you're a neoliberal shell.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2954,I'm not saying anything about him as a candidate.  I'm just saying he's not currently winning  and it's really weird that you have  a completely different narrative.  I think you aren't factoring in  how much I want him to win.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2964,If you do that and you remember  that Obama came from behind,  then you can see that actually,  all those super delegates moved to Bernie.  Why does that do anything?  Because you said we're not supposed  to count the super delegates.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2974,Oh yeah, no, you count super delegates  if they're for Bernie.  This doesn't make any sense.  I got a same surprise.  I didn't realize you hate Bernie this much.  I don't hate Bernie.  Look, I'm just saying if you look at the numbers
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,2987,and if they don't change,  I feel like you're setting yourself up  for a huge disappointment.  I'll bet your $10,000 Bernie wins.  You don't have that kind of money.  Oh, first you assume I have all the money I want.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3003,Good ones.  We are main pioneers.  Wait, how are we?  Wait, is female landlords?  Is that the one girl from chat?  a  connected

lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3065,There's no way this was posted on my sub first.  However, we are the ones that did bring back the, um, the gnoming people and we never got credit for that. So we'll take credit for it.  True.  Fucking, you're, ha ha ha ha, Mr. Mental. How are we doing today?
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3085,I'm good today.  Yesterday I was really tired. I had like four hours of sleep the day before or like that night day of and then, you know, today.  But today I'm good.  The mental is unbreakable.  Unbreakable.  I won't flame a jungler a single time or I'll gift you 100

lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3121,Okay.  Rokazama.  God, it's playing.  Oh yeah, don't you owe your chat something  about damages and Karthus and second dick,  your own dick on a stream.  Were you gonna be doing a twitch or chatter bait?  Oh, stinky.  Damn, that's brave.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3147,I'm dead because never mind. I'm so good  You get him  Shouldn't I  Wait, so there's basically no point in looting in this game, right?  Or like you don't spend a lot of loading. Yeah, it's um a lot more. Yes
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3175,I mean you can do the thing we didn't pub you wait and stuff, but um there's no looting  Random ass things yeah, sure looking for like 27 different types of attachments or whatever  Yeah, you're looking for like your fucking 4x scope, which I think is good
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3190,I also like how if you open a crate or whatever the all the loot just fucking drops on the floor. I think that happened in the other one  drop that. Cars in this game are fucking super good. Yeah, and then if you called on your
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3210,dropout after getting cash, you're basically like fully kitted right? Yeah.  You have better shit than default stuff right now.  Fuck does this guy fucking get in here every goddamn time we're gonna start using a new room  Wait, what did you ask Danica and hear you? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I only hear these talks against like Jewish people honestly coming in here
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3236,That we tell it to Taborin like into I was playing the jay card  He always plays the jay card  Hold on I gotta turn down up  Okay, Dan talk, I need to make sure you're up.  Hello, sir.  It's fine.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3252,Oh my God.  When we play late, we are swapping rooms and no one is going to be in here.  Just a fucking first off.  You're so like aggressive, Mr. Muhan.  When I see you in person, you're so nice, but then I'm in here with you and Steve.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3276,You know why you know what he's not doing in person  playing League of Legends dummas  I'm waiting for the longitudinal study on League of Legends and like domestic abuse towards your house really you think that's like a good thing that people should
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3294,I think that's a correlation. I think they should get rid of League of Legends. Do you think they should be?  infected with something maybe  What?  No, you can't even make that you're gonna get bad. Are you is that what well that sounded like where you were going?
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3307,No, that's where you were going  Are you sure about that?  You want to clarify for the audience?  I'm calling you you want to clarify that for the audience so that people are yeah, I don't even know how you've connected those
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3323,So what do you guys think of that band what is we already everybody thinks it's bullshit like gonna be  No one.  It's not bullshit, then you got a real hot dick.  Go ahead.  No, no, I think it's bullshit.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3333,It's bullshit.  This would be like the perfect, this is such bullshit, this is the perfect one for the  Twitch streamers to rally around and say, hey Twitch like, well they of course they  were because Casey Tron makes fun of, they always view her as like a parody of thought
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3347,streaming so people are okay, good fan of Casey Tron because I can still use her as  if I hate one.  Play with touch, not mood.  True.  Wait, what?  since Casey Tron is a parody it's okay to laugh when she does things like
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3360,booping out and everything like you can still hate other women while still liking  Casey Tron that's okay oh no that's that's not what I was getting I'm talking  about like twitch streamers aligning against twitch for like their their oh
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3371,twitch streamers have always been against twitch's stupid fucking moderation policy  everybody knows yeah but they don't they don't actually like get what are we  gonna fucking do yeah what are you gonna do man I don't know you get like a few
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3381,of those 8k and he's just stop streaming for two days maybe they're not gonna  I ever do that.  That's never gonna happen, unfortunately.  It would be cool, but yeah, it's never gonna happen.  That sucks.  I tried to see if any of them were on,
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3394,was that site called Cameo?  See if I could get them to say something against Twitch.  And then, yeah, but no, none of them,  none of the big ones are on.  Steve, what am I doing for stocks?  Give me a pick, I'll do it.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3408,Socks?  Yep, stock.  Oh, stocks.  down nor in the next month.  By Norwegian cruises, it's going down down down.  Is that your cake Stephen?  In a month.  I here is my honest to God hot take ready.  I have a super hard time believing that the United States is going to not do
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3430,some radical action to redirect the economy within the next month.  There's no way that we can just endure this for weeks and weeks and weeks.  Like, how many times do we trip the breaker now?  Is it three, four times?
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3442,What do we, how many have we done it so far in the past couple of weeks?  Okay.  Fair.  Like, how long does it take to pass any legislation like that?  I mean, in the form of stimulus, I don't know how long did it take Bush to get his little
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3453,stimulus bullshit through.  Well, here for the airlines to get filled out after 9-11.  Do you think we're going to let that happen again?  It seems like our monetary policy and stuff related to that has gotten more and more aggressive.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3463,No.  I don't know.  Yeah, like people are saying in chat talk got passed in a week like it feels like we've been more aggressive on that  But it could be wrong  It just if like you understand right that this is like
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3477,Catastrophic like even other European countries are enduring like catastrophic damage right now  The idea that this will just go on for like maybe a month or two. It seems that seems unfathomable to me  Like people are getting laid off like en masse like banks are gonna start hurting is like payments and stuff
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3494,for not being made like, my guess, wait.  I'm tempted to, I'm tempted to stake you, Dan.  We can go in 50-50.  Because Dan, you know that like,  if the stock market is going up, those are puts, right?  If it's going on a call, it's calls.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3519,I feel like as soon as the US government announces  something related to like stimulus,  that shit is gonna go fucking massively up.  Do you think that it's gonna be like a fucking five  to 10% rebound in like a fucking day?
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3531,Well, it's only if you believe that,  if the market believes that Trump can do it,  like we just had Trump's conference  and now a fucking American is $10 right now.  It's fucking crazy.  Yeah, but they don't actually have like
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3543,a single stand together, right?  Like people don't think that it's.  So do you remember watching that Srele stream  for a long time ago where he was analyzing eBay.  You know what I'm talking about?  Sure.  Like he was an master of power.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3558,Throwing money.  We need to find out what the asset  really is of some companies.  Stops are value based.  And then hold on one second.  I got a 20.  He is in the dumpster right now.  OK, sorry.  What were you saying?
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3569,We need to find out the asset value of a company.  And when it gets close to that, we  need to go fucking hard long on it.  So what is the value of American Airlines assets right now?  I don't think it is.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3580,Right now, asset value probably has  little to do with how you value a company like that. It probably is more tied in with like revenue,  right? No, no, sure. But I mean, there's kind of a floor for this, right? Like American Airlines
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3592,is certainly not going to go negative. Like I look at what happened to Yahoo when that was getting  acquired, right? And the assets that they had in... Yeah, but this is all conjecture. I don't know.  Okay. But like the problem is, is like, let's say that we let's say that we value the underlying,
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3608,first of all, the underlying assets of the company are probably going to be like a fraction of like,  like what the company's actually worth now.  And secondly, even if we try to make a valuation  like of the company based on just the assets,
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3617,if it gets to the point to where the prices are that low,  don't you think those assets would start falling  in value as well?  No, no, I'm sure.  So that's totally makes sense.  So yeah, I don't know.  I've been following American a little bit,
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3628,but like, you know, I'm looking at the spy now.  So I don't know.  What are you, so you think shit's gonna get  go massively up in the next month?  At the end of the month,  you think it's gonna be higher or lower than the price.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3638,Anyone else flocking board?  I mean, I feel like the end of the month has to be higher, but I don't know I'm not confident about my market analysis  I'm not gonna take it alone and like invest or some shit
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3646,Like I don't actually know that that would just but my it feels to me like by the end of the month shit has to be different  That like no one can do this for this long. It's too much
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3655,Especially when you've already seen like other countries that are like kind of like fixing their shit  Yeah  Do you think this is the time to fucking giggle hey  I'm gonna keep gambling it and be broke by tomorrow and have to sell my hands.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3673,Nice.  Yeah.  I actually came here to confront you, Steven.  What's up?  You're kind of mean to me yesterday on stream.  Well, you came in a metal during league, so get fucked.  I just said hi.  Yeah, during league, didn't you?
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3693,It's like touching a bear and fucking with it and then it's being yeah  But I'm not I'm not confronting you on be on my behalf because I'm used to your abuse  It was the fact that you guys left paper in here by himself and you kind of just ditch taper and that was kind of messed up
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3706,Yep, that was your friend  How do you feel about that the u-class team?  Doesn't matter me and my actions do not control you and your actions. You're a grown fucking man  They definitely treated your friend like shit. Nope. You basically came in and you moved us all out of there
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3719,We're supposed to be your friend as well. I can't actually believe that you did that you came in and know where  I  Get in here with us and I said you came in and you got him kicked a fuck out what W am I right?
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3731,Oh my god, I feel bad for women. Well, he's in here now. So yeah, I don't know. He's pretty mad at you  He's not mad all right five grand Steve. What are we doing? I got six Dan  You have six thousand you want to put into this we're ready
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3747,I'm ready.  We in Robinhood ready to go?  I don't have to cash it in Robinhood.  I can put it in now, I guess.  What are you investing in?  We're figuring that out right fucking now, Lycan.  Bring an apple as he seems to know, right?
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3761,I trust anything.  Apple has to say more than fucking me, dude.  Apple is getting in here.  Tell us what to do.  All right, Steve.  I'm ready.  I'm almost done with this card game.  Yeah, no problem, I did.  And we're ready.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3773,Are we looking for FDS or are we looking for like?  F.D.'s nuts.  I was just gonna say that, but you're so funny,  an awesome Mr. Mooten that you did it first.  No problem.  It's funnier, cause you said it anyway.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3791,Not true, women can be funny.  Hey Dan, why don't you open one of those green screens again?  What the fuck?  Apple is, what are we doing?  All three of us are going in.  Tell us now, what's the play?
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3804,Apple is, wait, Apple is.  Do you think that the US can just take this for like a month?  It feels like something has to give, right?  Either some crazy stimulus package  from the federal government or something?  Yeah, I mean, everything's fucked.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3817,But my industry is completely fucked right now.  Everything is shut down and there's  like everything's going out of business.  Yeah, and it's going to be another,  it's not like going to be, oh, you can't end it.  Like my kid's school is out for a fucking month.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3830,Yeah, like the governor of California  said that all public schools are going to be out  until at least July, so.  Wait, what?  Yeah.  All public schools, you mean like universities  are like great school and shit?  No, I think like high school, middle school,
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3850,and like all public, you know.  Thanks, Dr. Guma.  That's insane.  So if we know that that's the case,  doesn't that mean shit is like, oh,  Meg is gonna hit the fan?  No one's gonna be buying anything.  People are gonna be staying in in the fucking panic.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3864,Yeah.  We do what we do in puts then Apple is I mean if you like that was we're asking you  Tell us what are we doing the problem is I'm like I'm day trading right?  So you just I just look at Dow futures from day to day and that gives me enough indication of which way the market's gonna try
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3882,I mean for for the next day, so this is your insight. You can't help us. We just have to fucking guess  Yeah, I mean that's essentially what stop trading is right fuck me  The region cruises man $60 steady for years it's down to 10 right now
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3899,It's probably gonna drop a little more before their quarter  It's gonna go bankrupt because who's gonna bail out a cruise line  I mean, that's any ready hold on mr. Millen wait a goddamn second. Okay, we're trying to make money
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3910,This is what you need to do you're gonna make money you just lie already made wrong wrong wrong  I made money. No, I didn't I want to see my fucking shit  I hate money. Yeah, go ahead fucking fake news fucking
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3922,Let's not be so hostile take a breath  I made money mr. Mooten because I had fucking golden hands and I held through when American was pumping and then I sold fucking today  Okay, now we're talking about the next is is Mooten getting in on this because aren't you exclusively trading on margin because you
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3941,I have like $6,000. Oh, excuse me who the fuck would trade not on margin when you take it's free money  I would get free.  All right, Destiny.  I'm sorry.  Let me introduce you, Appolas, to the concept that has rich people use, called OPM, okay?
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3957,Other people's money.  That's how you get rich, okay?  Keep going, Mr. Mooten.  Get as much margin as possible.  That's the only way to trade, baby.  All right.  One month puts on the S&P 500.  What do you think, Steve?
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3969,It depends on the premium.  What is premium?  Is that how much you pay for the option fee or whatever?  What is that?  Current price it's 20 bucks. It's 20 bucks right now. Apple is that too frisky?  Thanks helpful as always
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,3989,Can say nothing we're trying to make the Dan trying to make money here one side. Okay, I'll log in okay  Apple is so so the issue is like this fucking ball up. What if what if they push through like an
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,4002,850 billion dollar stimulus plan in a week or two and  and the market spikes accordingly, like I don't know.  Okay, we think it's, I think it's going down.  Steve, are you a downer or an upper?  Tell me.  I said it was an upper.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,4019,I feel like it has to go up.  What if, what if, but what if they try to pump it  and nothing happens?  Like the market hasn't responded much to the feds,  like interest shit, right recently and the repo should.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,4030,It's swung for one day.  Yeah.  So like if they try to pump it and it doesn't go up,  Like if we like what I'm curious about is like if it seems like the Fed is ineffective at getting anything done here
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,4041,That's really fucking scary  Well, then the next step would have to be some form of government stimulus and that should get something done, right?  Then with the money printer is literally gonna go burr  Literally gonna go burr and we're gonna study you think that's gonna happen. Are we going up or down Steve?
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,4057,It's gotta go up. That's  Long it's going  Long long long we're going one month, baby  So so what what period of time we can go longer than a month if you want to but let me see what the prices is
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,4071,Do it day by day  Just fucking no word every fucking that's too much work. Okay. We think it's going up. We're gonna buy a call  Okay, money goes bird  We're gonna look at April 17. That's about a month April 17th calls
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,4087,On this going down Dan  Are you yelling timber?  Okay, and these are also down because the shit's going up. So do you want to buy it at the current price Steve?  Good luck, Dan. I think so. Wait wait for a call do those automatically like
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,4104,Execute or whatever at a certain price like how does that work again?  Like if we got something to certain price you just like make a ton of money or do you have to like  Do the option or whatever executed or whatever?
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,4114,How does it work?  Daytrider wait, then you're the one buying it. You should know this right fuck that shit yolo, bro  I don't need to know how this shit works press the fucking buttons make money  Apros the button money goes burr
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,4126,Okay  all right a call on  S&P 500 okay, so we have the right to  Buy it at this price in the future so we want to do it at the current price which is about  $231 all right, so that cost us 20
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,4148,Do we want to do that for a month out that means for a month we got the right?  To buy it at 2 31 oh  So okay, so you can you can execute that whenever you want to write it
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,4162,Yes, you can you can sell the contract  It depends on if you're buying a European or an American style option wait real quick was league patched already  is Draven's W faster?  I don't think so. I didn't download anything, but I don't know.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,4176,Apple, I just want to read your European option. You can only, you know, only actually redeem it at the time of expiration of an American option. You could redeem it at any point prior to or at expiration.  We're never buying European options.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,4190,But it, it, like they call it a European option, but it does, it's not necessarily restricted to European securities. You understand that.  Yeah, that makes sense  Chat he's making me do this  So Apple is any suggestions here  Yolo Dan
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,4214,Boy, I'm glad I fucking brought you in here to say nothing. I hate people like you people who say they're an expert  You ask them. Hey, what should I do to say? Oh fuck the bye? No, Markie goes up. Markie goes down useless
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,4225,I'm not a fucking expert. What the fuck should I know?

lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,14007,We all know if Afrobot did the same thing he wouldn't have gotten banned  Go to untaper  Fuck where is they hated him because he spoke the truth  So many emails do you delete emails after you read them I should do that yes every time what um what role do you need to get in this room?
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,14041,special snowflakes  No, this one is like I  I didn't even know what role it is.  Only person who have it are Yumi and Dan and Tabor and Keke, because he has an...  So if you want people in this room, you gotta drag them.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,14060,Do they got special snowflakes?  No! That's already the other one!  Destiny's room is special snowflake.  This one is the drag room.  No because special snowflake doesn't get you get caybird is not a social snowflake. I'm pretty sure what I just said was right. You're triggering me. Oh
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,14080,Oh no special snowflake doesn't get you anything. I'm pretty sure I  Can check that perms if you want  Permissions only harktons fan club and admins  I think he's a huge one.  And I think Heartland is the only person in this fan club.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,14095,Caw.  Listen up, okay?  You need to give me a free cheeseburger, a free milkshake.  You gotta do something if you want me to take a goddamn fucking survey, okay?  Don't, if I go and buy some shit at a hotel,
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,14120,and whatever, I don't do surveys for free.  Why do people expect you to fucking take your time  to fill out these dumbass fucking surveys  to help them with their market research?  What the fuck, pay me.  Pay people to do these things.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,14129,What the fuck that shit?  DeRue.  Safe space are the twins, and their names are very similar.  Oi, Yasuo is a tech damage, right?  80, save.  Names are very similar to screen time.  It's this idea that these are turned into
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,14148,five-year-olds, times and gravity shit.  That they don't see as derogatory to take those words.  All right, sorry, Wes, you're back.  Wear them as badges of honor.  Safe Space is kind of a big,  burly, stereotypical jock.  He can create force fields,
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,14164,but he can only trigger them  if he's protecting somebody else.  Snowflake is non-binary and goes by they-them.  Snowflake has the power to generate  individual crystallized snowflake shaped shurikims.  The connotations of the word snowflake  in our culture right now are something fragile.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,14182,And this is a character who is turning it  into something sharp.  Snowflake is the person who has the more offensive power.  And safe space is the person who has the more defensive power.  The idea was that they would mirror each other
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,14196,and compliment each other.  Snowflake and safe space are the twins  and their names are very similar to screen time.  It's this idea that these are terms that get thrown around on the Internet that  What the fuck?  What?  There is a new hero is called Snowflake and...
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,14216,Triggered or something.  I don't know, what was the Snowflake and what was the other one?  That are like non-binary Jesus.  Wait, and what?  New Marvel heroes or something they  What why are you leaving me blackface? Oh  I
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,14251,Don't know actually maybe he's got a good point. Oh, please don't it's so stupid  I needed fucking drama. It's literally the guy who made your fucking DNA. So I was the one who made it for me  So.

lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,14303,Dogs are way too much fucking work and you're going to hate your life.  I feel like I can get like an old dog, like a six-year-old dog.  No, that's even worse.  Why?  But then they don't need to like run around with you.

lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,18255,What does mean testing mean again?  Means testing is where like if I want to administer a social program  I like you there's like an income limit or something for it as well  Basically makes it a lot easier to fund things and it makes it easier to um
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,18267,To target the people that need help the most rather than just giving like blanket protections to everybody  Oh  I'm sure on top sure wait wait star is pushing but it's really weird to spot  Realistic was anything bad about bailouts and saying a lot of corporate socialism bailouts stuff
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,18289,But no, there's nothing bad about corporate bailouts anybody that says the same as a fucking moron  At least not any that the United States does  However, if we are gonna be bailing corporations out to stabilize them in the economy
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,18299,It's probably good that we stabilize like the people too, so there should probably be some sort of like cash transfer  To like civilians and non-businesses  Which you guys are just fucking hamming it out aren't you  the

lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,18352,confident that they have no idea what they're talking about and you can just ignore everything  they're saying. Vibax have nothing to do with anything. Anybody that brings them up just  heard it off a fucking Twitter thread. They couldn't tell you what a buyback is. They
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,18362,couldn't tell you why companies do buybacks. They couldn't explain why it's preferentially  do a buyback versus a dividend or why one is better than the other and it should be better  than the other. They all they know is that CEOs are compensated with stock and sometimes
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,18372,they do buybacks. Therefore, they're bad. That's the only thing I can tell you, okay?  Fuck out.  They're all absolutely  going from  meaus testing and reaction to the renowned sense of all years of course or 5 times and  a whole Corp Jessica means testing a certain case is conducting for sure when you are like healthcare education the cost

lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,18469,For the fucking Corona shit. I'm fucking fine. Okay. Anybody that's making over 250,000 a year doesn't need a fucking cash transfer  For the fucking coronership, you're gonna be okay. All right, you'll live not working for a couple weeks, okay?

Okay. Let's say we want to give a thousand dollars to every single fucking American
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,18524,Okay, let's say that we means test this and and let's say that one third of Americans don't qualify  Okay after we means test it  330 million people times one thousand dollars  What is that?  That's like is that like 330 billion dollars?
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,18541,Do you think that's the cost of the administration there?  That we're gonna need to fuck 330 billion dollars to figure out that maybe you know some Americans shouldn't qualify for this  Fuck out of here with that people listen people here bureaucracy and they instantaneously assume
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,18552,Oh, administrative course is gonna be tens of trillions of fucking dollars like fucking chill Jesus.  I would like shut up $1,000  Hey, hi, can you get on?  Yes, I can  Not to mention the fact that a lot of this means testing is already
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,18578,We've already paid for it because the IRS already has that fucking information you can just make it go off of your 2016  I'm sorry your 2019 taxes  Are we confirmed to be getting some amount of meat bucks I would be shocked if there was no if there was no
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,18593,I would be shocked if that didn't happen  Give me my goddamn meat bucks now  Now.  OMG, this yelling is making me cum so hard.  Let's all cum together, cummers.  Invited table.  3, 2, 1, cum.  Biobax for just corporations being idiots and gaming the system to over inflate the value of companies,
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,18623,not related to getting checks from the government only related to what are you talking about?  Everything you do inflates the law, you restock.  Oh no! Did you just open a new factory?  Oh, you're in play in the value of your stocks!
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,18631,Oh no! Did you just invest in a new project and now you've got some new technology?  Oh, you're over in play in the value of your stocks!  Like, oh no! Like, everything inflates or deflates the value of stocks, but that's what you do.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,18639,A stock buyback is returning cash to shareholders. It's all it fucking is.  You could pay out on dividends.  If you pay out on dividends and then some people want to buy your stocks,  because oh wow, they pay higher dividends, whatever,
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,18647,are you over in play in the value of stock?  They're like, fuck out of here, dude.  That's not real value, no assets.  Shut the fuck up! Please stop. Please stop. Please stop.  Don't talk about buybacks.  We don't talk about buybacks here, okay?
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,18656,Every single time a progressive or a left-leaning person  brings, it does inflate their stock.  So does, so do, paying out dividends is another way  to return cash to shareholders too, right?  Like, let's say that there are,  let's say that we have 10 stocks, okay?
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,18670,Or let's say that we have five shares  and we've got a million dollars, okay?  I could either spend that million dollars  to buy back five outstanding shares  and double the value of all these people's money  or I could pay each of them a million dollar
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,18681,in the form of a dividend, okay?  A million dollars in the form of a dividend.  Like, it's just returning money to shareholders, that's all it is.  The thing is that dividends are taxed, and the appreciation of the value of a stock is in text, you sell it.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,18691,That's the only difference, okay?  Stop.  And every time somebody says neoliberal, you can also pretty safely send them no fucking idea what they're talking about either.  Oh God!
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,18723,Sorry, I'm sorry for screaming at you in chat, okay?  I don't hate you, I love you.  My bad.  Are capital gains only half-tax in the States as well?  Hell no, in the US, capital gains are texted  Like fucking one third or some shit capital games brackets are insanely fucking low. It's unreal
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,18737,Now we're nearly out of this line of skill.  Wealthy stay wealthy boys.  Fuck me dude.  Fuck me dude.  Yeah, moving.  One.  His AFK, just let me kill him.
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,18772,Two!  Two, Mooten!  You have amped page don't care kill is it kill baby  Just kill me I want to die  Why were buybacks illegal before Reagan buybacks were illegal for a small point of time  But buybacks were also legal like back in the fucking 1800s or whatever the reason why buybacks were made legal is
lsL88Xgv1fg,20200318,18803,It's not because they were so atrocious for companies or whatever stop stop. I don't want to talk about buybacks again  I don't want to talk about anything finance or economics related with any lefty. Let them moralize  Okay, just make moral arguments. Okay, companies are evil just stick to that
