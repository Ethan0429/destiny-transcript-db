KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,1410,Spent a rival 20 minutes hell fucking yes  Okay, I have to go down in 20 minutes to pick my food, okay, okay, all right  right? Pixie, we're treating some real crazy stuff. What's going on? Talk to me.  Okay, to start to under Sam, where I'm coming from, like, we have to start from the perspective
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,1432,of like, I guess history, right? And I know that we talked about this in the last podcast and we  disagreed. But I truly believe that right now the closest, like the closest point in history,  America has ever been to like right now, like the closest parallels is seen like in 1920s, right?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,1451,Where you have big economic differences between like rich and lower class, where you have like,  you know, a great depression recession, where the world, you have rising ideologies of like  fascism and authoritarianism, and where at least in the US, what I think like curved out or didn't
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,1470,and let it take place was a whole implementation of like FDR's policies that I think today  would even be considered socialist just because of how much like the term socialist has kind  of shifted in a sense. So I look at what we have now and I get really scared because
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,1489,I think you know I think Donald Trump has fascist tendencies. I think that he does talk  about a lot of nationalist rhetoric. He blames minorities, Hispanics, specifically targeting them.  Same time, the whole idea of this powerful enemy at the same time is all-powerful but all-weak.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,1511,He sees them, I would say, as degenerates. I look at the recent Donald Trump policy that he put  into place where he suspends evictions and foreclosures, which is like a policy that  not even Obama took into place in 2008, right? So this is considered what I would consider
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,1532,like a lefty policy. And then I see, talk about implementing perhaps like a UBI. And  I think like, yeah, if you have a, you know, candidate that's about as like nationalism,  Now suddenly passing a couple of lefty policies that I would go as far as to say considered
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,1553,populist that the Democratic establishment did not pass, then you're going to have populists  who used to be for Bernie Sanders, right?  Because they're like Bernie Sanders with a lot of populist policies as well, who care  more about populism than progressivism.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,1568,So I think those people are going to be much, much more inclined to vote for fricking Donald  Trump than for Joe Biden.  That's really scary to me because I think like,  Trump is honestly a pathway to fascism.  So that's where the new comes.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,1583,So, okay, so a few things to keep in mind  so that we can kind of be a little bit careful  where we're, where we're,  where the comparisons that we're drawing.  So my understanding of the Great Depression  is that the entire world's economy lost 25% of its GDP,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,1601,that it was like an unimaginably horrible thing.  Yeah, whereas by comparison, I think 2007 was like a couple percentage points  It was definitely bad  But nowhere near the level of economic  destitution that the Great Depression left us  2007 was like that
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,1620,And GTFO and GTFO right now  I don't think that this coronavirus is gonna be like that. It's gonna suck for a while of course  But I mean maybe we'll get there. We'll see  I'm sorry 2008 not 2007  First thing to keep in mind, in terms of like suspending foreclosures and whatnot, Obama
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,1638,took a ton of actions, including TARP, to kind of make it so that the economy doesn't  completely and totally die during the 2008 financial crisis.  It wouldn't really have made sense to suspend foreclosures during that crisis, though,  when the crisis was literally a housing crisis.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,1655,Like overvalued property and everything was like a huge driver for what actually caused  everything to collapse.  sure if the government intervening on behalf of people  to stop those properties from work closing.  I don't know if that would have been a good idea or not.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,1668,I'm not sure.  In terms of implementing UBI, I don't think Trump is going  to implement UBI.  I think he's probably just going to do a one or two time  cash stimulus, which I mean, even George Bush did that.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,1681,That $600 check rate, whatever that went on to everybody  for that stimulus.  And I think, was cash for Clunkers?  Was that under Obama?  I think it was.  You're a little young for that, but I  I think I remember that we basically could take like any old car and and trade it in for like like it was a lot of money
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,1694,I think I don't remember what but it was to get old cars off the road  So I mean like people have like implemented these types of cash transfers before they're not completely unheard of  Yeah, I don't think that Trump is like doing some like I don't know to call Trump's economic policy like lefty
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,1706,I guess like you could call it lefty strictly speaking maybe but definitely not progressive in any sense of the word  I don't think so I don't think there's a huge worry that like  like progressives are gonna vote for Trump
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,1717,just because, you know, he's trying  to keep the economy afloat.  So there's a couple of things here, right?  I get like earlier on, I was like tweeting,  I definitely got confused with the word like progressive  and like populist, right?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,1730,So my argument is not that progressives are suddenly  gonna start voting for Trump,  as much as it is that the populist who used to align  with like Bernie Sanders because of his populist policies  and used to align with like progressives
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,1743,are going to see what Trump is doing and then go for it.  I think, yeah, it really depends.  I think if it's a one or two time cash stimulus,  I don't think that's going to be enough  to declare a populist policy.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,1758,But I do think if it is implemented,  I was like, I don't want to say standard thing.  I don't really know the right word for it.  I'll use standard because I can't think of another word.  As a standard thing, then I do think it's something
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,1771,to maybe worry about.  I mean, if that was the case, then that would be a win then.  I mean, strictly speaking, there's two ways to look at it.  It's one, you would be forcing the current president  to endure some form of what we would consider
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,1782,a left-leaning economic idea, which would technically be good.  And then two, I think something that's more important  than that.  I don't think that there are that many hard-line populists  that are voting for Bernie.  I know that online, it seems that way,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,1795,that there's a lot of socialists, there's a lot of populism.  I think that the main, like, Bernie shared  a huge coalition of voters of working class,  uneducated or lack of education, people that with Biden,  like Bernie Biden shared that coalition of voters.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,1810,I don't think that all of these people  are like insane populists that are ready  to just vote for Trump.  I think that's, yeah, I don't think that'll happen.  That doesn't seem to be the case at least.  You're right that I'd have to look at the numbers,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,1822,like Bernie and Biden and supporters that overlap that way  because like I'm kind of, I guess still stuck  in like 2016 logic.  I just sent you like an article  about like Bernie supporters like in key states,  like key swing states that voted for Trump.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,1837,But you're right that I would have to look at  Biden Bernie supporters and where they overlap.  Sure. And I mean like Bernie,  so this article has to do with the title of this article  is The Bernie Voters Who Defected to Trump
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,1847,explained by a political scientist.  So these Bernie voters did defected Trump.  But one thing we have to be careful of,  and now we have a little bit more information  because of how the current primaries are around,  we don't know if these voters defected to Trump
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,1858,because they had a populist band  or because they were anti-democratic party or whatever,  versus how many of these voters just really  didn't like Hillary Clinton, who was a super-ultrated politician.  Because states that Bernie, either won overwhelmingly  last time, like I think Washington or Michigan,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,1875,or like Rust Belt states like Michigan,  he lost pretty handily to Biden this time.  So it seems like maybe it was less about populism  and maybe less about that type of political ideology.  And more just, Hillary Clinton was a deeply unpopular politician
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,1888,due to the years and years and years of relentless attacks  on her by the FBI, by the media, and then  by Republicans in Congress.  Then, yeah, I definitely have to retake that into consideration  to decide if I still keep my standpoint or not.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,1909,I don't know exactly how we find the numbers  until after voting about the amount of people  who like defected from like Bernie to like Trump  or kept with Biden.  Well, I mean, even if they did, like what's the alternative?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,1922,I mean, it's not like, I mean,  some people that were going to vote for Bernie  will probably invariably vote for Trump.  I mean, I'm sure it's the same.  A lot of Yang supporters will move too.  And in some percentage of voters
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,1932,from everybody else will probably move around.  But I mean, that's just the nature of a primary system  and the nature of the elections.  Like some voters move around,  like there's not much you can do about it, no?  Yeah, no, it's just my biggest fear
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,1942,is that the whole idea of passing populist policies  that are appealing to the left is going to bring  voters who were populist who used to align  with progressive ideals to the other side.  That's, I guess, my biggest fear.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,1959,Yeah, that's definitely possible.  But I mean, what are you gonna do?  A populism is brain rot.  I mean, I've said this over and over again.  It's one of the reasons why I caution people on the left  that kind of push for this anti-id-pol,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,1970,anti-liberal, in-Paul ideology is pretty scary,  because when you start throwing away stuff like,  all identity politics are all intersectionality,  it's pretty easy to go either hard left or hard right,  if literally the only thing you care about  is economic policy.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,1984,It's possible that Trump could implement a few things  that deceptively appear left-leaning.  But the reality is, is that new conservatives  aren't really hardcore married to capitalism.  Tariffs, that's a highly anti-capitalistic idea.  Locking down the border,  that's a highly anti-capitalistic idea.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2001,I don't think that Trump is a hard line capitalist.  And I think that he'll pretty easily implement  these different types of left-leaning policies  if he sees them as popular ways to win an election.  Well, yeah, then the question is like,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2011,to me then the foremost priority is convincing  Biden or establishment Democrats or whoever it is,  like trying to warn them like,  hey, you know what, like this can be like a real threat  if this happens.  Like you should-
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2024,What's happening, Nick and do?  I mean, it's Trump is president right now, right?  Well, no, no, but I mean, like the whole idea of like,  you know, maybe it would technically be all talk,  but trying to adopt those policies as well.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2036,Um...  I mean, I'm pretty sure every Democrat is like,  Biden has his form of universal healthcare.  Biden has his form like 15 an hour minimum wage.  Like, these are policies that I'm pretty sure  Biden's administration would already be willing to do.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2047,I didn't Biden himself, did he tweet out anything  about the cash transfers about like a 1000 a month  UBI thing or something or...  Not from what I saw.  Okay, I mean, I'm pretty sure that like any mainstream  Democratic politicians should be on board with this. I mean they all happen. I mean there was even home refinance except under Obama
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2062,Like it's unlikely that Biden would be unwilling to consider any of this  Okay, well, yeah, I guess that's it. Yeah, that's a good argument. I just like I'm just nervous  I  Guess like what matters to me the most is that yeah either
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2080,Makes it more clear or tries to I guess campaign more on those fronts  Well, he can't campaign on the ultra progressive fronts because those fronts are loser policies  for winning elections, right?  Like we can't just because we're like regardless of how we feel about how the primaries turned
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2096,out, like Bernie got crushed.  It doesn't make sense that Biden would now adopt Bernie's entire platform when he got  absolutely annihilated.  Well, I'm not saying to, okay, I have to refine the numbers of healthcare because like I remember
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2109,like at least in Michigan, the people who pulled out did agree with universal healthcare.  But the problem is like nobody really knows what universal care means like even today  We pull on it like nobody has any idea what that entails
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2119,I think there was a KFF poll that came out showing that like there's a million different ways  You can ask the question people still don't know like what exactly it entails hold on give me like two minutes  I gotta run out of my food. Sorry
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2135,Hi GG how y'all doing?  and how's your day? I'm gonna I'm gonna go full-griff now. I'm gonna convert you guys.  reasons very straightforward.  Oh fuck tankies.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2169,Go.  You guys are going too fast for me to read.  I'm fucking slow as fuck.  I, you know what?  I'm just, I'm waiting to be canceled.  You know that's actually a dream of mine.  The train.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2213,What does the train...oh is that biting with like laser eyes?  What the fuck is that?  You guys are giving me a fucking headache.  Honestly, I'm not going to do the boomer meme.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2245,No, I wish I had as much confidence as Boomer Girl.  Hey Pixie, how's it going? Hi, what's this? Wait a second, let me check. Is it just  tell me? Is that I have to go scroll back? What do you mean you don't know who it is?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2260,Mind waves? Of course. Mmm, you think I'm gonna vote for fucking Trump? It sounds like  it the more you talk. I definitely am not gonna vote for fucking Trump. What? I do think-  What's going on in here?  Mind waves during the battle.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2278,Well, I just want to know, like, if you really  met populace in that instead of progressive,  when you said that, which populace are you talking about?  Because I hope you know that left-wing populism  is much different than right-wing populism.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2292,Is it?  They function in similar ways, but they value different things.  Right?  I'm not completely sure about that, right?  because isn't the whole idea of populism in general  is doing like, well, I guess then we would have  to define populism exactly, right?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2308,Because when I think about populism,  I think about like what's best for like  your own population most of all.  So my understanding of populism is,  populism is essentially when you have a candidate  that identifies that every establishment is the enemy,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2323,and that candidate is promising like salvation  through them and them alone basically.  like, so Trump and Bernie are both populist because Trump and Bernie both say, look, the  media is against you, the politicians are against you, the establishment is against you, and
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2337,I'm the way out.  That's essentially what populism is.  Right.  And if you dive a little bit deeper, the reasoning behind both of these parties is completely  different, right?  And that's why left-wing populism resonates with a certain demographic of people and right-wing
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2351,populism resonates with a certain demographic of people.  You could say that there might be some overlap, but to say that it's a significant amount  that's going to determine the election and make sure that Biden has zero fucking chance.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2363,I just don't see that as being-  We could just look at what happened last election cycle.  It's not like a fuck ton of Bernie voters jumped ship and voted for Trump.  We didn't say that happened.  Well, that's right.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2371,I linked the article that was like around 12%, which was enough in these swing states.  So maybe not across the board, but it definitely impacted the final result.  Yeah, but I think it was worse that we had-  I mean, again, there's going to be some percentage of voters.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2385,It always moves.  But the worst thing was that all the Obama voters just stayed  home.  Like Hillary just didn't galvanize the base at all.  And that's not untypical of any election.  I think that around 10% is pretty typical of most elections
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2403,2016 and others included, right?  All right.  I guess I'm just having trouble because I'm using it.  You guys are making really valid points, right?  That Biden is not the same thing as Hillary.  Hillary didn't really like motivate people to go out and vote.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2424,But at the same time,  I think a lot of people are motivated to vote against Trump.  But I do think that he has a very heavy fan base.  And now that he's trying to implement these policies,  I'm just, do you guys think it's an out-there argument?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2442,think that like there are going to be  populists out there that are like, well,  he's he's passing these policies that  are that our own establishment is even passing.  No, no, no, these aren't these aren't policies  Trump are passing. These are literally like
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2455,last resort economic emergency measures  to keep the system afloat.  And most of this is going through Congress  not being implemented by Trump himself, right?  Like the wasn't the stimulus that was  suggesting giving families like a thousand  bucks or whatever wasn't that being like
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2471,uh, pass through Congress, not Trump's administration.  Yeah.  And these are just a couple, like a couple of times, doesn't it like UBI forever or  anything?  Yeah, I guess my biggest contender would be about the housing stuff about  the like halting mortgages and stuff.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2487,Yeah.  Yeah.  But even under, even under Obama, like there were plans to like refinance your  home or whatever.  Like, but you say that's the same thing, like refinancing your home and  like just spending more to get more, more, more to just, and
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2500,evictions all around  Well, I mean like  You you couldn't do that in 2008, right? Like the whole problem was that the housing market was like completely and totally fucked  I don't know if just freezing everything  Would have been like a way to do that
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2516,But I do know that like the home affordable refinance program was something that happened other the Obama administration to help people  to hound off like foreclosures.  But also that was the catastrophe there.  It was so much different than what we're facing right now
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2529,as well.  Okay, because I was going to say,  yes, it's a different crisis,  but the whole point is that this policy scene is one  that helps a lot of struggling people, helps working class.  And if, again, I guess it goes back to,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2546,I don't know if this is circular logic or not,  a hero populist who buys into like the anti-stab- anti-establishment rhetoric and you see this  guy who is going to help you.  But he's only doing it in response to a catastrophe.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2560,Like if you're a dumb enough as a voter that you see like, oh wow, we're getting something  under Trump like in response to the world economy shutting down due to a pandemic.  I mean like your pr- that person is probably lost to all form of reason anyway.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2573,That's why I was saying this prob- this person that you're talking about probably isn't somebody  that would have voted for Bernie Sanders because they're a progressive.  This is somebody that is probably a moderate and undecided, right?  Oh, I definitely have to think more, but you guys made really good arguments.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2591,Yeah.  Um, so yeah, that's it.  I'm not going to vote for Trump.  Fuck you, mind waves.  Um,  look, it's just what I asked you if you were going to vote vote for Biden in the  general and you said I don't know maybe I started becoming very worried about you
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2608,that's all I'm saying yeah probably it's not much better I'm just saying yeah I  said probably and then I said like later like okay I probably should not say  probably because I mean like probably like unless if he has like a heart attack
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2621,and dies but people are not gonna take it that way right people are just gonna  hear probably and things like that you know wait wait wait wait wait wait wait  just to be clear that's not how you meant it though right when you said
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2631,Probably you mean you would consider not voting for him. You're not you're not worried about the part of it because I guarantee that if I go back  Through your vods, you've never said like oh, I'd probably vote for Bernie you'd that you would have said you definitely would vote for Bernie
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2642,Even though Bernie could I definitely would vote for Bernie. Yeah, but you wouldn't vote for Bernie if you had a heart attack and died, right?  Yeah, I wouldn't yeah, she would write him in no shut up  So we know that like when you say probably vote for Biden
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2655,It's not because you're thinking of a heart attack  It's because you would legitimately consider not voting for Biden for whatever reason  Well, yeah, I was thinking like extremely like terrible fucking circumstances, but those  are not realistic, right?  So I should not use the word probably.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2669,Probably.  And I just want to be clear that the reason I had a big issue with your tweet is because  it came off as like literal praise for Trump.  It didn't come off as somebody that was skeptical of Biden.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2679,I thought lecture fan literally wrote that tweet when I read it.  That's, I actually need to be a little bit more precise if you're going to make that  sort of point, I guess.  Okay, because there was like a previous tweet that was talking about like I
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2694,Forgot about exactly it was it was talking about like not this is them basically like national socialism  And like the rise of that and that's the first tweet before I started like my freaking rat  Which is something that I agreed with right like during the way that not the boat
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2711,I was saying before the way that not to stick power was during like a time of economic distress  as a national sentiment, also talking about socialist sentiment, but then when actually  getting into power, not implementing any of that and getting rid of a socialist instead.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2726,So that was like what I meant.  That was like the first prelude before I was talking about like if Trump does any of these  policies or talks about implementing any of these policies, then we might be in deep
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2736,shit.  I think that that is a real phenomenon.  I just don't think that this specific instance is indicative of that.  is like in the same state as like post-world one Germany. I don't think that's very comparable.  I mean we can find some like pretty surface level comparisons but
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2750,I don't think we're like about to just slide into Nazism because Trump tries to like  stave off the economy from completely dying. Well no it's idea that during times of like  long economic distress or times of like economic stagnation people usually look towards more
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2766,more extreme measures to change your situation, right?  So if you have like a long period  where that economy doesn't seem to be growing  or where it seems to be stagnated,  then you're going to look for other solutions.  And that's when usually like have fascists
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2784,or like write like extreme right-wing people  take advantage of those fears or those wants  and gain power because people are looking for something.  I mean extreme left-wing people  take advantage of those fears as well, right?  Like anybody could theoretically capitalize
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2796,that you know yeah but um the whole idea and maybe this is just my complete  utter bias is that it's kind of easier to do with like fascist rhetoric or with  authoritarian rhetoric because and it's gonna be condescending people who tend
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2812,to already like lean towards that area are less likely to question less likely  to like critically think critically think against them they're much more  susceptible to like authoritarianism I mean I think I think that would be true  of like all sides. I know United Exactly is talking about like I reject the
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2827,characterization that like the Bernie voters just like highly like this highly  knowledgeable voter that is super informed about all these issues like the  amount of tweets I've seen of people that I don't know if you're doing this if you
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2838,did it or not but like the amount of tweets I've seen of people looking at the  1.5 million repo thing that the Fed did and comparing that to like well we could  buy you know education or student loan debt off or whatever I don't know I don't
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2848,feel like these people they like highly knowledgeable voters that are like  making good decisions based on like sound policy or anything.  Hey, that money printer go burger though.  You know, this isn't even a money printer though.  But the idea that I'm like trying to like put into place is that, yes,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2866,I would not say that there's a bunch of like highly super educated,  like brainy voters and that's the case.  Um, but that I feel like left to some itself is prone to questioning, right?  the whole idea that like, oh, why is it always easier
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2881,for the right to unite and for a leftist?  Like, that's a lot harder.  And I think it goes back to the idea that leftists  are like kind of like always arguing about like ideology,  economic policy, things like that,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2892,while like most righties are just.  No, it happens on the left hand, right.  Like we only see it because we're looking at the left,  but like the freedom caucus, for instance,  has been like a thorn in the side of the Republican party
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2903,for quite a while as well.  You know, the whole Tea Party and all that shit  that moved so much of the Republican base  over. This idea that infighting only happens in the left isn't necessarily true. It happens  politically to conservatives as well.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2918,But I mean, wouldn't you say that conservatism in itself is based on this idea of like tradition  and the respect to authority?  I think conservatism as an ideology in the America right now, in the United States right  now, sees itself as government's job is to give people the tools that they need to succeed.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2938,And that's the job of the government. That's like what conservatives believe.  That communities and people can take care of themselves and the government only exists  to provide the absolute bare necessity tools for people to do that. I think that's what conservatism
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2949,is kind of about. Okay, because I look at, you know, I look at like evangelicals that like  right wing like extremists, I look at even like Trump itself. And it's always like, you know,  don't question, keep to the judicial structure, like, you know, adhere to your authority.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2969,And then I look at the left and people, people don't feel that shit.  Well, that's because right now we're in primary season. Like during when Trump was running,  the Republican party was pretty fractured as well. Like we forget this, but for all the talks
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2983,we're having of like, if Bernie won the nomination with the DNC take of him, the Republican National  Convention was seriously like being talked about as well. A lot of people were wondering,  are the Republicans actually going to allow Trump to be nominated?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,2993,Like, we don't know. Are they going to steal the firm and give it to Cruz or Rubio?  The Republican Party was highly fractured back then as well,  and then eventually they came to go to the Trump. But...  I guess my question would be, do you think if like Bernie Sanders theoretically won,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3008,do you think the left wing will fall in line with him?  Because I'm not sure about that statement either.  Well, they wouldn't fall in line because Bernie Sanders isn't popular  the Democratic Party.  That would be the problem, right?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3021,They don't want to lose their seats.  This is why a lot of the Republican Party has fallen  under line of Trump is because Trump is incredibly  fucking popular.  So if you've got a president with a 95% approval rating
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3031,and he's in your party, then yeah, of course you're  going to toe the line because you want to win your election  again in your district.  But if you get Bernie Sanders, I mean,  if Bernie Sanders is more popular in the Democratic Party
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3040,than yeah, I mean, people would probably fall in line as well.  If he was a very popular, how high approval rate  because they wouldn't want to lose their elections either,  right?  Oh, so I was just asking like in theory because I wondered like
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3051,I mean in theory if they if everybody if Bernie won with an overwhelming amount of support from the Democratic Party  I think 100% they would fall in line of course. Yeah  So how's my Twitter  Oh, I wasn't reading it. Um
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3069,Did you delete the tweet? No, I didn't delete the tweet. I don't like deleting tweets, but  but if we are getting like the wrong impression,  maybe I should.  If Trump's ends up doing any of the following,  suspending or eliminating student loan debt.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3083,So I don't think Trump has talked  about eliminating student loan debt at all.  Or at least I haven't heard of that if he has.  Implementing UBI, I don't think that a one time  or two time cash transfer to hurt American families
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3093,is the same as UBI at all.  Well, yeah, I agree.  And then implementing Medicare for all,  Trump has definitely never talked about  implementing it in Medicare for all, I don't think.  I just don't think any of these things are things
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3103,that Trump was realistically talking to.  Yeah, no, I was saying like, specifically,  like if any of those things end up happening,  I feel like we're fucking screwed.  But I agree, like UBI is very different  than a one or two time cash payment.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3117,Yeah, but if this all was to happen  and you were like a Bernie supporter,  then you should be happy, right?  Like, oh no, Trump got rid of all student loan debt,  implemented UBI, and now we have Medicare for all.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3128,Like that's successful then.  That's like the president bending to the will  of the American people.  that that's what the American people want, right?  Well, it's good, but it's also bad in the sense  that I honestly think Trump is a fascist, right?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3140,And this is how we get like with like kind of like  Nazi socialism.  And this whole idea that I honestly think  that if he gets like a second term into power,  we're going to lead to like more authoritarian measures.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3151,So it's good in the sense like,  damn, like I was able to get policies  that I really agree with past,  but then it's bad in the sense that I really worry  about another four or more years of Trump
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3160,and the power it's going to have.  But then we would have to talk about identity politics,  then, because now we're moving on to social issues,  if that's what we care about more than economic issues,  which I care a great deal about.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3169,I think social issues and economic issues  are two sides of the same perfectly balanced  Thanos dagger, which is one of the big contentions  I have with a lot of left-leaning people.  So for instance, when Hassan says things like, oh,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3181,there might be some meaningless cultural issues  that Democrats and Republicans are different on,  but economically, they're all the same or whatever.  Well, I think that a lot of those meaningless little issues,  like gay marriage, or things like prison reform,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3193,or things like sexism or racism,  I think that these are actually really important things.  I don't think these are just meaningless little quibbles  between the two.  But if you constantly push aside all forms  of identity politics, and you only want to talk
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3207,about economic policy and all you care about is class,  then I don't think you should be too surprised  if it only takes a couple economic policies from Trump  to get people over to that set of the aisle.  Well yeah, so shouldn't we be worried about that
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3221,if those economic policies are enough to get somebody  in the other side of the aisle, but-  Well yeah, of course, this is why I constantly  shit on socialists because I think  class production is more stupid.  I think identity politics is really important.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3231,I think intersectionalism is a really important lens  to view people through.  But I think that most Democrats are still generally  on board with that.  It's only the people on the,  it's only like the Kyle Kielinski's and the Michael Brooks
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3240,and all of the, and the Hassan Pikers,  these people that are like really far left  that are in danger of like all of a sudden becoming Trump voters.  Like a person that supported Obama or Hillary Clinton  or even Biden isn't just going to randomly become
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3253,a Trump voter because they actually care about children  being locked in cages at the wall.  Or they actually care about Trump,  just talking about shit hole countries  or rapists, Mexicans or whatever.  But people that are very far left that are like socialists
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3265,or whatever, they don't actually care  that much about these things.  They just see it all as another form of class struggle.  So it's easy for them to switch between Bernie or Trump  because it's not really that much difference
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3273,between their overall ideologies in terms  of how they approach political things.  I have the same chief criticism of Trump and Bernie  and that they're both highly protectionist.  Like controlling immigration from borders  and controlling exports and imports via tariffs and stuff,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3291,like Bernie and Trump both align completely on that.  Thinking all of our trade deals are catastrophic  and they ruin the American worker,  Trump and Bernie are lockstep in that type of ideology.  Empowering local American businesses  of I American worry about America's Trump and Bernie
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3304,are lockstep in that.  So yeah, I mean, like economically speaking,  there's not that much difference,  I don't think between like a left populist  and a right populist, you have to go to the social issues  to actually start to find different decisions.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3315,Again, even on that issue, I would say at a surface level,  that's true, but if you look deeper the way  that they wanna solve these issues is completely different,  right?  Like Trump wants to like shut down the border,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3325,he wants to say that we're gonna bring cold jobs back,  whereas Bernie wants to shift the economy  in like a different direction.  So like I think that like the policies that they propose is different  But like the way that they approach to approach the issue is definitely similar
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3337,I mean some of the policies are similar some of the policies are different  Like I think Bernie and Trump would both be on board with tariffs  It wouldn't surprise me if Bernie could be moved to be more anti-immigration
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3347,I don't know exactly where he stands in terms of how open the border should be. I'm not sure  I know that he's okay. I think he was okay with amnesty for Legals  But yeah  Yeah, I mean, like Trump would never be pro daka pro like all that shit like pro immigration like like Bernie has come out being being pretty pro like for the immigrants in that sense. Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Whereas Trump would never wear the Democratic parties right now.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3373,Yeah.  Mm hmm.  Wasn't Bernie anti H1B visa?  I'm not sure.  That sounds like a program that he would be against, sure, because he would want American  workers to be hired instead of foreign workers.  I mean, but like, are you guys kind of worried in that sense, right?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3393,We're worried about what?  So yeah, it's true that, and I've talked about it before, that Trump and Bernie do share  like similar economic policies, but they're very different when it comes to social issues  for sure, right? I think that Trump's racist, Bernie isn't, right? At the end of the day,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3410,that's what it boils down to. Yeah, if you care about identity politics, then that's where  that critique would come from. Bernie is against open borders as well. I didn't realize that.  He calls it a Cook Brothers conspiracy. So yeah, Bernie's probably closer aligned to Trump
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3422,on immigration issues than most people realize. It would be my guess if you had an  in-depth conversation about it, but I haven't heard him talk about it too much. I'm not sure.  But like this whole idea that um, what is it? Acting is if people only care about identity
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3437,politics and like not economics. I feel like that isn't like a very safe view to take when it comes  to the general election. Um well no, I mean you have to you have to take into account both, right?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3449,That's the important part. You have to worry about the id poll side and you've got to worry  about the class side, right?  Well, do you think that DNC is doing a good job  when it comes to the class side?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3459,Well, I mean Biden is overwhelmingly  destroying the primary so far, so it seems like it.  I guess, I mean, what should they  be doing that they're not doing right now?  Or do you mean the Democratic Party in general or?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3471,I guess I mean like the Democratic Party in general.  Or I'm not sure.  The Democratic Party right now can't do anything.  They don't have any control on the Senate.  They don't have control of the executive branch.  So I mean.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3480,There was something else.  There was something I was going to say.  I also have like kind of, I guess, a contention with the idea that, and I know it sounds contradictory,  but the idea that primary season is like a very good way to gauge how the general election is going to go.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3497,You know, Hillary Clinton won the primary, like with a lot of contention. I think that even if like  Biden wins the primary, there's going to be still a lot of people who are kind of not content with that.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3508,I don't think that's like being properly addressed.  I don't know how you'd address it to be honest, but I-  Well, he's starting to try to address that by adopting some of the policies of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, right?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3521,He's already tried to make that step to appeal to the progressives.  Well, he didn't he literally like adopt Elizabeth Warren's plan to about like a-  for student loan debt or something like that?  I'm not sure I didn't hear about that.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3535,Yeah, he made a big announcement recently that he was taking some proposals from Bernie and some proposals from Elizabeth Warren.  Yeah, Biden, I'm just looking real quick, a Forbes article titled, Biden Forgive Student Loans in Bankruptcy.  So yeah, I mean, it wouldn't surprise me if they had like...
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3551,I mean, I already know, I'm pretty sure Biden is already in favor of like a national minimum wage.  I know like a 15-in-hour minimum wage.  I'm pretty sure Biden talked about massively like his massive Medicare expansion that he wants to do to build on the ACA.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3565,Biden is already a fairly progressive-ish candidate,  not as much as Warren and Bernie,  but it's not like he's not pushing  for any left-leaning ideas, I don't think.  Oh, he endorsed Warren's student loan debt bill  in free college for less earning under $125,000.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3585,I mean, you could make criticisms of like,  well, maybe you think that he's not genuine in that proposal  or that he's just adopting it to pander  towards the votes that he needs to get elected,  but I mean, we really can't know that
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3596,until he gets into office at the end of the day, right?  I mean, this is one more thing I'm afraid of, right?  Let's say Biden does when he gets into office  and he doesn't actually try to pass these proposals
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3609,that he's talking about.  Then don't you think that's gonna lead  to like a bigger backlash,  like the next four years after that?  Yeah, I mean, of course it could if he lies  and he gets into the lower person.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3618,People said this four years ago though.  Well, I mean like, yeah, but I mean like what you just  described that should happen.  If he gets into office and he doesn't pass anything,  Yeah, there should be a backlash, of course.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3626,Yeah.  And that's how you move the Democratic Party more and more progressive, right?  Which has been happening.  I mean, just four years ago, you look at the establishment candidates that were pushing  policies and they're far less progressive than the establishment candidates like Biden
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3642,and Pete Buttigieg and stuff like that that are way more progressive than they were even  for eight years ago, right?  So.  I guess like what I'm just thinking is that if at the end of these four years it doesn't
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3659,happen.  I honestly think a lot of people are going to lose faith in the American system or in  American elections because you're going to be like, okay, well these people will talk  a lot of the talk but they don't walk the talk.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3672,So I might as well.  Well, the problem is like politics are hard.  The problem is that a lot of people assume that all of America is on board with this  and the only thing standing between them is the Democratic Party.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3682,But that's just not true.  Obama only had Congress for two years.  And even as part of that, fighting for the healthcare plan he got in was a massive uphill  struggle.  People think that whoever gets into office can just pass their entire agenda via executive
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3696,fiat.  For the first two years, if Biden or Bernie were president, you're still going to have  a Republican-controlled Senate.  Not much is going to get done.  you know, unless some Republican Senate seats are actually being threatened by some of these policy positions,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3709,you're not going to really see Biden or Bernie pass a lot of legislation or any meaningful legislation through Congress regardless.  But I mean, that's just the system working as intended, you know?  You have to get support across the entire United States for you to actually get stuff done.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3721,I mean, none of this really changes until we consider electoral reform until we change the way that our democracy works.  Even if we did change a like to reform, you still have to get like even if Hillary won the popular vote
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3733,It was by three million votes like there's still a lot of people that are Republicans  We for some reason when we're online  We just assume that like 95 percent of America are liberals and only five percent are conservative
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3742,They're just dumb hicks stuck out in the in the stick somewhere  But that's not true a lot of Republicans in the United States that we just seem to not even recognize their existence of  Right, which is why I think lately I've been trying to make a point to if you're really a progressive
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3756,We need to work more on not becoming jaded,  just because our candidate didn't win an election  and more focus on doing what we can in our personal lives,  kind of like advocating for a cultural change  in the United States to make our politics more conducive
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3772,towards progressive issues in the future, right?  I think the idea-  I mean, I definitely agree with you.  But I'm not gonna lie that I'm a little bit salty  because I feel like if you do want to make progressive
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3785,politics more progressive in the future,  you do have to address like systematic issues  that happen within the Democratic Party  or the idea of hate, you know?  I would argue that one of these things,  or maybe this isn't like specifically the DNC,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3801,but more like these local, I guess like the local state party  of the Democrats or whatever.  But for example, not having a lot of like voting booths  or voting locations when it comes to like college campuses,  right, trying to get voter turnout to go higher
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3819,when it comes to youth, addressing the problem,  like the fact that Biden doesn't even want to-  But Democrats have fought for voter rights  like harder than Republicans.  Republicans are the party that are constantly trying  to get like voter rights like taken away from black people,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3833,from minorities, from younger people.  Like they're the ones that are pushing for the national  like Democratic party is like, for the past decades,  like fought against this pretty relentlessly, you know?  No, I agree on a national scale.  I'm talking about addressing reform within the own party.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3847,I don't think Democrats in their own party  are trying to destroy voter turnout.  I think when it comes to young populations, yes.  Especially when you look at university campuses  and the voting selection there,  like the voting booths available to go vote.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3866,I think also this is why maybe this sounds  like really bad for you guys,  But I think the fact that Democrats talk a lot about Black voter turnout,  which is necessary, absolutely,  but then completely ignore Hispanic voter turnout,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3881,I think that's also kind of boring, right?  How do they really see that?  There's a annoying Hispanic voter turnout. What do you mean?  Well, you're right. In the last debate, they addressed it.  I'm probably like before that.  That Bernie Sanders was getting consistently higher Hispanic vote.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3896,But whenever you do, you can do news channels and nobody ever mentioned that.  Well, I think that because Hispanics haven't been seen as like a primary backbone of the Democratic Party the same way that the African-American vote has been.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3907,Like, that's probably going to change in the future as Hispanics. They might have already become the largest demographic group in the US.  So I know they're on their way to being that.  But like, there's a couple of like structural issues with Hispanic people as well. For instance, Hispanic people tend to be far younger than African-Americans as well.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3920,And historically have- And far less likely to turn out for elections, by the way. That's why you shouldn't rely on the, like, Hispanic vote to win an election solely, right?  Yeah, and then also like I don't think that Bernie is necessarily crushing it with Hispanics as hard as it seems
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3935,When you actually take into account who shows up to vote  I know that a lot of the polling has him like pretty up there  But I mean on the flip side, you know a lot of the polling has Biden crushing African-American support as well
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3946,Mm-hmm  Yeah, no, I guess like I was trying to like address was these ideas that if the Democratic Party  be, it's true that young voter turnout is not as high as it should be or that we would  want it to be. But the whole idea is that as these voters grow older, as the Democratic
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3965,Party keeps progressing, they kind of do have to eventually adapt to these ideas or risk  alienation from this growing base.  Well, yeah, they will. But I mean, it's not like Hispanics are moving over to support  Republicans anytime soon, right? Like even the last Republican Hispanic group in the
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,3983,is where I'm aware of Cuban people.  But even they, I think, are now majority Democratic voters  as well.  It's not like the Democratic Party is losing that voter base.  Well, maybe losing to Republicans not necessarily,  but the whole idea of becoming more unmotivated
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4000,or completely washing their hands off the system.  I mean, I guess I could happen.  But I guess we'll have to see in the general,  right now the voter turnout has hit insane highs  for some of these primaries.  So it seems hard to believe that these people all just
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4013,they'll disenfranchise with the system.  I mean, they're trying to get out of the way.  And we have more of a youth turnout this time  around in the primaries than we did in 2016,  which you could say that, yeah, 17% isn't enough still,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4025,but it is more, right?  And I think that you're right to point out  that some people may feel alienated from their democracy,  but we don't solve that by just throwing a fit, right?  People like you and anybody else that considers themselves
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4039,an advocate needs to encourage young voters,  despite their, like, despite being disenfranchised or, or despite being  discouraged from participating in, in democracy, they need to actually go  and show, show up to vote, right?  Like that is crucial.  Yeah.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4054,I don't think anybody disagrees with that.  Yeah.  No, I definitely agree with that.  Um, but I guess like when I'm trying to bring up, is this whole idea that there  is also just a giant divide when I come to the university with like Biden and
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4067,Bernie, right?  It was a giant divide for what?  Biden, Bernie, I think it's like voters who are 35 years or younger, overwhelmingly more  for Bernie Sanders than Joe Biden.  And it's like, you're right that we have to, sorry, you're right that the whole idea
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4093,or the whole solution isn't to throw a fit.  I guess I'm just asking you guys what can we do to bridge that divide?  Well, we don't have to bridge it right now. Young people just don't vote.  Like that's a divide that you worry about bridging when they become like election relevant, right?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4107,That's like we're like that'd be like you're coming up to a turn  That's a mile ahead of you  But you want to turn left right now to get ready for the turn  Like you don't want to try to appeal to younger voters that aren't going to show up and then lose some of your older voters
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4117,As a result of that like you appeal to the younger voters when they get older and they start voting I think  Oh, yeah, that's absolutely true.  Mm-hmm.  Like, it seems like, like, I understand, like, we're in a pretty unprecedented era right
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4131,now in terms of, like, the pandemic.  But like, and not, not to, I'm not trying to accuse anybody of, like, any motivated  reasoning, but it's, you can't really say, like, if you're a Bernie supporter, like,  oh, now is the time where Biden is to start taking on all of these Bernie-approved economic
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4143,plans when it seems like Bernie was pretty sadly defeated in the primaries by Biden in  most of these states.  So it seems strange that that's the path forward.  Like if it was, it feels like the turnout  would have gone a little bit differently
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4154,in a lot of these primaries.  I mean, I have a kind of trouble talking about  primaries being an accurate description  for the general election.  Primary, I would trust primaries a lot closer  than I would pulling, right?  Primaries are actually like,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4171,this is the closest we have to the metal meeting,  the grindstone or whatever, the pedal getting the metal  in terms of finding out what are people actually going to do.  can pull people to where blue in the face, but primaries are where you actually go out
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4182,and you cast one ballot for one person and that's your vote.  Yeah, but I mean, I'm trying to think about how to explain this in the best way possible.  I feel like the people who are voting for Biden want to return to normalcy.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4196,They want things to go back to the way they were.  People who are voting Bernie are definitely not like that.  They definitely don't like the system how it is right now.  So if we're in a general election and if it's like Biden versus Trump, you're going to have like Trump's hardcore fan base
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4212,You're going to have some acceleration is but I think those are a minority  And then you're going to have independence who weren't going to vote like Biden anyways  And might have only been interested in Bernie for like whatever strange reason
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4226,Who are also like might vote Trump right and I don't think I don't think that there's this huge independent  and it bends towards Bernie Sanders.  Like it always seems like we're pretending  that there's this massive demographic of people
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4238,that are ready to vote for Bernie in the general,  but wouldn't vote for Biden in the general.  Like wherever we can try to dig up these magical voters at,  there's gonna be 50 times more of them  that would have voted for Biden over Bernie
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4250,if Bernie would have gotten the nomination,  or at least that seems to be  how the election is turning out right now.  Like I'm sure there's probably some independence  that won't vote for Biden for whatever reasons  that might have voted for somebody like Yang
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4259,or somebody like Bernie,  But I think that number is relatively insignificant.  When you look at the massive turnout,  the Biden was able to get  for people that are voting for him.  I'm not, I have to find exact numbers right now,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4272,which is what I'm trying to do  because I don't believe I agree with your statement  that Bernie does not garner  like a larger independent vote than Biden.  But I would agree with your statement  that if Biden is able to get a large enough vote
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4284,to turnout, it would negate that anyways.  Which I guess just comes back to predictions  that we can't 100% make that of whether Biden is going  to bring up such a large voter turnout.  But that we can hopefully look forward to
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4299,because the primary has had a large voter turnout.  Yeah, I mean, I guess that's something  we have to look forward to, right?  Like we have to bring back the people that voted for Obama.  We need to bring them back to the voting booth
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4309,in the general and it seems like Biden  is the guy to do that versus Bernie.  Like Biden wants to build on the Obama presidency  quite a bit.  He was obviously Obama,  Biden wants to build on the Obama president
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4318,He was obviously Obama's VP.  Like it seems more likely than not  that he's probably the guy we would need  to bring those voters back to the voting booths.  Yeah, and I wouldn't undersell the voters  wanting a return to normalcy as like a,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4336,like as if it's like not a huge motivating factor  for a lot of people, right?  Like having Trump in office is a huge motivating factor  people to turn out in masses for Biden.  Yeah, I definitely have to think about some of the arguments that you guys said more,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4358,but I do agree with a lot of them.  Yeah, I don't know what else to say.  I think I'm just gonna, I'm gonna go.  Sure.  But thank you very much for talking to me about this and to keep my mind on something,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4370,so I appreciate it.  No problem, be careful.  Don't be a socialist, okay?  be a socialist just be a good one okay  thanks I love you later  In all my long year of keeping up with American politics, I have only ever seen two passable
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4405,presidential candidates, Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump.  Now because the DNC has schemed against my boy Bernie by letting old people vote, we won't get to see these two giants go head to head.  On one hand, this is kind of a good thing because now I won't have to see my two dads fight, but on the other hand, this is great news.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4420,Because now I get to see Trump cave a centrist head in while screaming,  How many times do I have to teach you neoliberals? This lesson!  That being said, I've come up with an idea to unite America against the centrist men's.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4431,Make no mistake, this is a battle between centrism and anti-centrism.  That's right fellas Trump Sanders 2020 here's how Bernie can still win  I don't want to see any coalition building with the centrists. Okay, the center always plays this game
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4447,Curling the left and the right to work through them to get anything done  They never expect the left and the right to go around the center and crush  Okay, well I have to um  Get my stream ready for
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4460,My shit  Hey guys, listen up, okay?  Let me just get you glad your back dad's tiny love you bud.

KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4562,Maybe you wake up on money like, okay, fuck it.  I'll just clean just my bathroom.  Okay.  You don't even have to fucking mop it.  Okay.  Maybe just clean the toilet, throw out all the extra shit from the shower, organize the
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4572,drawer just one room okay and then go about your day you know what you'll find  out anytime you go to that bathroom you'll be like man you know what feels  pretty good in here I like that okay but I'm not gonna do too much work today
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4584,only 10 minutes of clean today okay you know what the next day when you wake up  pick one other room to clean maybe you want to clean two rooms because you'll  feel even better having some right just do that and you know what once you have
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4595,your whole apartment clean you will feel better about your life okay shut up  What prompted this I don't know I know a lot of people that live really fucking dirty fucking houses  V has  V has so much random stuff
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4626,In like in her living area like she's got like a lot of gizmos and gadgets and odd some ends and like a whole bunch of shit  But her living area  Univalise is super clean. It's very very very clean
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4637,She's the only person I've ever met in my entire life that has like random shit that they collect  Well, I say random so I'm sure it's not random to her  But like the living area is like very very very very very clean
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4647,Especially and I'm gonna drop I'm gonna drop a true facts on you right here  I'm gonna drop a true fax and you're here especially being a girl because girls are fucking filthy a lot of the times with the way they live
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4658,Okay, because you motherfuckers throw clothes all over the goddamn floor, okay?  All over the goddamn floor. We're let let's see  We're all playing destiny and doom and pretending the demons are conservatives in  Preparation for pretending the angels and doom eternal or lefties
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4675,Also, I can't believe I have to say this, okay? If you're a girl  If you're a guy you should do this too, okay?  If you're a girl have a fucking toilet or not a toilet have a trash can in your bathroom, okay?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4689,Jesus Christ  If you're a woman and you have to fucking smuggle your your fucking tissue wrapped tampon to like the kitchen  Trash can or some shit. What the fuck? Okay, get a goddamn trash can for your fucking bathroom, okay?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4705,Holy shit, I can't believe that I know girls that do this, okay?  Don't do this if you're a guy and you're gonna have a girl over having a trash can in the bathroom  It's also I don't know why you bring someone over all their period though
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4718,But anyway, there you go also oh oh  I want to just be you know what maybe it's cuz I'm 31 now  Maybe I just want to become daddy Steve, okay? Although I learned this shit when I was fucking 18, okay?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4732,At least it's something I don't care right now what you're donating  There's a good video who debunks the general speech so that like you say the voters don't affect legislation  Hey, but  socialism done left  Okay, well look at this later
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4747,Here is another thing like I'm sorry. These are just like little basic life things, okay, okay?  Number one, okay toilet things if you're a guy, all right  You should be using toilet paper every single time you go to the bathroom if you don't you're fucking disgusting
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4763,Okay, when you finish going pee, there's two things that you do. Okay? One, okay?  Get like two or three or four squares of toilet paper, okay? And wipe the end of your little dooders, okay?  I don't know maybe maybe I just have a- I'm not an especially healthy eater
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4780,But I don't know where you guys all have this problem when you put your dick in your pants. It's fucking you just piss yourself  That whole urinating fucking shit, okay? Don't do that fucking shake your shit wipe your shit down or whatever, okay?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4792,Jesus Christ, alright?  Why four squares? This is a two square job.  It's a four square job, okay?  It's not one square. What are you doing?  You're just gonna fucking dab it and get pissed over your hands.  The reason why it's a four square job
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4804,is because after you're done with that, okay?  Every single time you pee, every single time,  you need to take your toilet paper  and you need to wipe around the fucking rim  of whatever toilet you're using.  Because when you pee in the toilet, some of it splashes up
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4820,and it gets on the fucking rim.  If you walk into a guy's house, I'm gonna give a plea to women out there.  If you go into a guy's house and you for whatever reason, I don't know why you would do this if you were a woman,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4830,if you pick up a toilet, um, like the thing that you sit on, the toilet seat,  and there's piss, crust it, and cake all over it,  it's because the guy doesn't wipe it after he pisses.  That is fucking disgusting. Leave.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4841,Don't lay that guy. Just fucking leave, okay?  Every single time you use the bathroom, even if you just pee,  should be wiping the fucking outside to keep it relatively clean.  Jesus Christ, okay?  Was the end of SC2?  Do you not use a urinal? I don't have a urinal in my fucking house.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,4872,Steven you can see the bottom of the top of your monitor and the bottom of your  thread I'm glad I'm  I'm  I like it  fix it  Why don't you sit when you think well fuck why sit when I peed I don't want to

KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,6467,I can't believe you paid the ceiling green.  I'm going to switch to space.  There you go.  Thank you.  Thanks for coming.  You're welcome.  All right.  Now I'm in space.  Boys.  Dude, how are you doing, Khleibu?  Life is good.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,6481,Are you quarantine?  The difference.  I'm quarantined like every day,  all day, every year.  Exactly.  My life has to change at all.  Yeah.  It's like, I like you.  I like all the time now.  Like for me, it's like, Oh, dude, you can't go outside.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,6498,You have to stay in and play Path of Exile.  And I'm like, just same as every day.  That's the best thing about this.  Is that now like to live room and just eat is enabled to feature, like leave a door.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,6507,I don't even have to see people anymore to pick up food.  It's even less interaction.  That's fantastic.  Holy.  I'm not gonna lie, driving around LA  has been a fucking just, oh, bliss.  Like I can move like, it takes me like a minute and a half
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,6528,to go a mile now,  as opposed to like five or six or seven minutes sometimes.  Like drives it would take me an hour and 25 minutes.  I can make him like 25 minutes.  It's unreal.  This traffic a lot less.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,6537,Yeah, no just insane.  And then coming back, like I feel like I'm driving  in a normal city.  There's like a little bit of traffic at the lights.  I feel like I'm in Omaha, Nebraska again.  There's like cars, but it's like normal.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,6546,You know, there's like, oh my God, it's so good.  Oh, I love it.  But like awesome.  Yeah, they still drive like LA drivers though,  even though it's like small traffic.  So shit is getting done.  People are turning left.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,6556,It's good.  I like LA drivers.  Okay.  People make fun of the way people drive in LA.  I don't like the way people drive in the fucking Midwest.  Okay.  Or in the fucking South.  Holy shit, Florida is crazy.  Or at least Miami is.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,6566,But like, yeah, everything is just smooth as fucker.  The airport, there's nobody I walked through  There were more security people than there were fucking customers. I love that I went right to the front of the line got through security immediately
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,6576,The plane I had a whole road to myself. There were no motherfuckers on that plane. Oh my it was just amazing if this is apocalypse  Huh?  Not that I would ever champion that let me be very clear twitch
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,6588,Not that I'm saying that anybody because I don't want to catch one of these bullshit random fucking bands that are going through this site  No, holy shit. Can I get F's in the chat real quick for Casey Tron? God damn. She'll be back. Hopefully
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,6600,There's no way you'd think so right, but oh my god  Pretty smoothie. Yeah, yeah  Virus is the real deal, I guess  Hmm  How are you Trump?  What's up?  Well, you know what? I think the virus is a little...
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,6622,It's not all good news of the virus. I had to cancel one of my board game meds, so that's a bummer.  Didn't you do it online? Is that a...  Steven game?  Yeah, yeah.  And I'm doing other board games too to make up for it.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,6636,But, you know, this is serious stuff. I have to not play board games sometimes.  Well...  Well, what are you gonna do about it?  I don't know, man.  I still have to play more computer games.  My people tell the same story.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,6655,Dude, my business has completely changed.  I had to take an entire day off to work for the agency today, which I almost never have  to do because everybody's moving all their marketing plans to digital because they're  not doing anything in person anymore.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,6669,So they're all calling us up and asking how to do it.  So I'm like busy as fuck suddenly.  I thought that we were gonna be slow, but it's weird how some businesses they like go down  and other businesses are inverse.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,6682,Like we're trying to help a bunch of local businesses with marketing right now because  they're having so many problems with getting anybody in the building or even to order from  it.  It's crazy.  Well, because we're in center of Seattle where basically everything kind of started,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,6697,I guess, in the US.  Yeah.  this  rooms while  said  there were no way in there told a failure of house and housing in other  because they just came from um...  grand canary or something like would you know would
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,6719,could be good crazy um... fucking shit they're doing in the u.s. for screaming  people when they come back  yeah when i came back from them because i was just in sooten and  I was coming back to the United States at the front.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,6731,They asked you if you've been to any of the European areas or China, any of the affected  areas.  And then when you tell them, like I had to tell them I was, and then they sent me through  to like the extra screening area.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,6741,And the security dude asked me, like point blank.  He was like, do you feel sick?  And I was like, no.  And he was like, okay, welcome to America.  I was like, oh, that was it.  What the fuck would have happened if you answered?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,6751,Yes.  I don't know.  I just thought it was funny how easy I got it.  I was ready to be quarantined for like two days.  Like fuck, I'm fucked actually.  then um they probably have like a secret door and like the fucking special forces comes out
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,6762,yeah  ex-kater on the spot  Like in China the lever he pulls the floor opens underneath you and you're like a  It's like a coin-boost style dungeon dude like if they have a green dragon pops out of the piece of his breath left
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,6778,It's with a litty. It's 40 feet 20 or whatever yet  like  Kind of they got those loudspeakers that are like do not leave your house. It's crazy shit like that  Well, shall we um hop into game maybe we're down. Yeah, let's do it. Okay, we're not even in combat. This is great
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,6803,finally  All right, where last we left our party was about to speak with the dwarven thing  I  Recall correctly yes  Is that true  Isn't it true I believe it to be true  You're always hard when we miss two weeks because we need to do like a recap for the audience because a lot of people come in
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,6827,And they don't know what we're they don't even know what we're doing. They're just like I agree  Let's do a recap for the audience  Go for it Devin you got this shit. Oh fuck  I'm like, I'm like, I'm like super Alzheimer's.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,6843,So I'm like the worst person to do this.  Okay, I know that we were led through an area.  We were all blindfolded to or not all of us, but the humans are blindfolded.  We walked through so that they couldn't see anything.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,6851,I think we were walking to the thing guy through the mountains or whatever.  Right.  We arrived at him.  I don't remember if we were about to have our conversation and then we cut it off or what.  We left on a cliffhanger of some kind where they said we were looking for permission to
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,6871,go through to go into the tunnels so that we can free up the area between is it on?  Are you?  Are you?  Up there?  And and Yaka because we're trying to we're trying to clear out those tunnels so that we
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,6890,we can establish a trade alliance between those two places, right?  And to do that, we had to go to the thing and ask him for something.  What though?  Just to ask whether or not we can set that up since he's the leader of all
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,6907,these mounts. Yeah. OK.  Yeah, we've got to give the OK for you guys to go clear out those tunnels and  re-establish that trading base.  Right. And then we are going to do some work with  all the dwarves and like get some trade going between those two places because this is a this is an empire building campaign
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,6924,What we're trying to do is we're trying to unite this big island  We're on and we're trying to make it into like one big capital  And then we're gonna make like a bunch of empire based decisions on that and it's all to fight a really big monster
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,6935,That lives in the sea called the Kraken  And we build one great wall around our empire  What we're covered we have ocean on all sides of us why we need to build  We don't know what else is out there
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,6947,there. Well, I imagine if anything else is out there, it's  gonna fly in which case a wall probably would be very effective.  No. Can we call it the greater wall? The greater wall of  Arcadia. And we'll have Trump as our leader. Exactly. Can
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,6963,try to build the greater wall. I was thinking I was like, I  waste the money. Sorry for the aside, I was thinking I was  like, did your brand change significantly when he became  president. No, it didn't. Let's start the campaign.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,6982,All right. So you are about to meet up with the dwarven  fame. The other thing you got to get from this dude is this  is acts. Right? Yeah. So you were brought into the great  Your position here is to negotiate access to Langport,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7003,which is that dwarven outpost right here  that would allow you to easily move from  Yaka to the dwarves and then theory out here  and then over here and then over here.  You added mountain names, thank you.  Yes, every mountain is now named just for you.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7020,Ah, except the one in the top right  that we don't know what's called yet.  No, they're all named.  You might have to scroll to see the name somewhere.  Oh, except for the elven one.  Yeah, elven name is missing.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7033,So you were brought before the Dwarven thing.  Does anyone remember his name?  Oh.  Oh.  Does that mean we asked who his name was  in order to get in here?  Einhart Blue Steel.  No, that was the name of the other dude, right?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7050,That's the king that disappeared, you know,  a couple hundred years ago.  He never gave us his name.  Yes, you did.  Well, well, well.  Grim gore.  That's the one.  Wait, what?  Oh, nevermen.  I just have 400 IQ.  Yeah.  Thank you, McSack.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7068,You need 400 IQ to read which.  I was like, what?  I did not open, dude.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Grim gore blue steel.  He has promised you an axe.  And you are about to promise him that you're
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7081,going to, for of you, slay anything that might be in the way of opening this new  Dwarven mind.  Nougat.  Most things.  Post.  Anything, right?  Anything.  Well, not slay.  Just get there.  I don't like your idea of anything.  We can, right.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7098,I think we just have Trump kite.  How fast can a light?  Deep spawn, possibly run.  Right.  Deep spawns and Portias.  Oh, yeah, that too.  We have to, well, we have a lot of things to promise.  Yeah.  You have a few quests going on right now.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7111,You've got the get the dwarven hammer to unite all the dwarves.  That seems to be maybe a little bit pushed out though.  There is open the passageways to allow trade with IU.  There is collect the spell books that are the brass plates.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7130,There's get that nymph, but all they've done on that so far has been given an amulet of  what was it called?  that's supposed to like silently judge everything you do and let the elves decide  based on your actions whether or not you're good enough people to help supply this.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7145,Such an element item. It's a nymph spawner. It's a nymph spawner. What it does is  that we do X amount of good deeds and when the bar fills up a nymph spawns.  That's how they would probably do it in a CRPG. Yeah. Yeah. It's an incubator.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7164,Yeah, it's like a Pokemon going  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Or certain steps.  But it's, you know,  plotted by morality instead of, uh, stepping stones.  But it's a good thing trustworthy, not me.  We've been very good at this campaign.  There's been a lot of campaigns that are a lot worse, trust me.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7183,That is true.  And the grand scheme of D&D campaigns, you guys are as good as it gets.  I think.  Yeah, this has been, this has been,  we haven't killed anyone's son or anything.  Yeah!  No murder of children, where?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7196,Yeah.  Well, you were brought before the Dwarven saying,  Grimgor Blue Steel.  His guards are around him.  You see a pair of clerics with him.  Dwarves in full plate wielding heavy axes.  There are a lot of guards in this room.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7212,If you were to try and make a move on the sky,  you get the impression you would be dead in a heartbeat.  There are probably a few heartbeats.  They are dwarves.  It takes them a few minutes to get anywhere.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7222,They're kind of slow.  And the thing looks down upon you  and you see beside him is a long wooden case  with a big head on the end.  Like it might fit a massive axe.  But the case is closed.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7241,I say, hello Grimgore.  I did not think that your beard  could become any more magnificent.  I'm very impressed.  Your flattery gives your intentions away.  I appreciate your kind words.  Mink's keeper of Boo.  And here is Boo.  He is very glad to see you.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7271,I suppose you are here for your acts.  I have promised.  I am very excited to gaze upon the great  dwarven craftsmanship.  He signals to a nearby dwarf  who puts down his own axe, picks up the box  and walks over to you and opens it before you,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7289,revealing a massive steel axe,  superb quality, but when I say massive,  I mean, this thing is going to be unwieldy  for people that don't have enough strength.  So if you have less than eight strength,  you can't effectively wield this at all.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7307,If you have less than eight.  If you have less than 14 strength,  you have a penalty of two to use it.  If you have less than 18 strength,  you have a penalty of one to use it.  Otherwise, if you have 18 strength, the greater,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7322,you can use it with no penalty.  What's your strength?  Eighteen.  All right, that's gonna work out for you then.  The damage die on it is not D12, it is D16.  Oh, shit.  Nice.  As they open the case and you see this thing, coming with it is a strange radiance.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7346,You did best acts in the game.  But Neil, they don't make these 16 dice.  Well luckily we don't have to roll physical dice.  We have digital dice.  And you can also, there are D16 dice.  look a little funny they're non-standard but you can get them. Do we are they able
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7368,to make a handle for the flame sword? What do we ever decide to do with that?  Oh, we haven't talked about them about them yet. We should talk to them about it.  We might be able to get something better or trade for some people. We have a lot to talk about.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7381,And what's that? And the hit dies the normal, right? It's just the damage die.  It's just the damage die that goes up right since your strength is so high you don't have to worry about the hit change.  The other thing that they'd like to mention to you about this axe is that it has been enchanted by one of their clerics to always produce bright light.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7407,you weren't already in this chamber,  you would see that it glows for 60 feet  in all directions with a bright light,  which is maybe good, maybe bad.  You get to figure out what I'm about.  It's got MTX?  We need a hat for it.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7426,Ask for a hat.  What do you put on?  I have a name it, Tormundrend.  the king smiles very pleased that you are so obviously thrilled with his work the item has already been added to your character sheets and don't worry about it.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7447,And, um...  Okay, so I say...  Great thing on our adventures. We found this!  And I, in a non-threatening way, bring out the flaming sword.  You draw it bursts into flame as it goes.  There is a gasp of breath from one of the apprentices nearby, one of the smaller, less experienced storms standing by.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7475,How do the High Quarix react? One's behind him.  Why don't you give me an insight check, Grub?  And I will tell you.  The usual six. Oh, but never mind. You don't know anything.  I called it out specifically about to look at the High Quarix to know.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7496,Yeah, and I have magic, but you decide.  I think that you go to look at the high clerics,  both an insight check of six.  Like the sword is sort of distracting you.  So like, oh, Claire, whoa, that sort of sucks.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7512,Oh shit.  That sounds like the clerics are kind of like.  That sounds like something I would do, okay.  Yeah.  Did they say anything?  Did dwarves gaze upon your sword?  Did you ask them a question?  I forgot.  It does not have a hilt, and we do not quite know what to do with it.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7532,We only know of its majestic power.  A fine looking weapon.  Is there any way to put this inside the axe?  Regretfully there is not.  Would this be better than the axe?  Do you live in a world of absolute, better and worse?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7562,Yeah, I do.  Things are usually asymmetrically balanced,  better or worse as usually a matter of perspective.  Would you be able to forge a hilt for this sword?  It is a doable thing.  When it is finished, we would possibly be open for trading this for another item of
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7595,similar standing.  Hey, Ponderous.  Well, if we were to make a hilt on your behalf, we would have it designed differently than  if it was for one of us.  Tell us now if you wish to trade it or not.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7624,Well, if we end up trading, then you can just remove the hilt and pop another one back on.  Well, wait, hold on, just checking.  He gives you the look of like you're giving me busy work bitch  Does the can the monkeys any weapons ever or does that totally ruin everything for your characters, eh?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7642,How do you use simple weapons? I was actually thinking of the quarterstaff again  I probably should have been using it for this for this flame sword is the blade such a way that the only thing  I could be constructed into is like a like a short sword or an arming sword or something or
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7656,It is the arming sword longsword that it is now and it you couldn't reshape it or change it without ruining the magic on it  You make like a double wave sword like Ruar any tension which it does it's a blunt blade because he decided not to slay anymore
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7669,Well, no so like for for an arming sword does it always have to be like a strength sword or could this theoretically be like a deck sword?  No, it's gonna be a strength sword. Oh, okay. Yeah, so ideally I'd want to trade for something else useful for the group
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7681,Okay, the good news though is one side multi class the fighter. I could use a longsword. Oh  Oh, army sword rather.  Would that be better for you?  If it's a magical flaming fucking sword, probably.  We should keep it then.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7696,We'll keep it for Trump.  Okay.  Everyone's gotten something cool besides Grub.  You are cool though.  Aw, thanks.  Oh yeah.  And in exchange for making a hilt to match such a magnificent weapon,  What will you offer my people?  I've been pondering about this for quite a while.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7723,A lot of different...  What are the other dwarves called?  The dwarves of Blue Mountain, right?  The ones that aren't in this case?  Other dwarves has also asked us for the great hammer.  We would like to commit to recovering the hammer in your name.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7745,And that is why we are trying to obtain as much power as possible because we have discovered that it is guarded in fact by a deep spawn  When you say the great hammer  you mean  The great hammer of blue thing
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7767,Blue steel a a heart I know it blue steel  the hammer of Zorin, you have the hammer of Zorin.  We know of its location and what guards it,  and we want to help grow cover it  in order to secure our alliance and our friendship
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7786,with your majesty.  Give me a check.  I  Think this is a persuasion Jack  And you need to touch me  I would think it'd be a little bit weird to do it right now inside of everyone  Oh, I could touch him
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7819,That doesn't matter if I touch him. It's a pretty bad role  should I ask a quick meta question?  Oh boy, I'm gonna get help for this but here we go.  Do you think things like that should be decided by precision checks?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7838,Things like what?  If we're in like a role play and he says some, I just want your thoughts.  I'm not like, like, yeah, if we're in like a role play situation and he says  something that's like compelling and based on a lot of factors like it like it could be
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7853,you know his position in the world and things like that like should we should it come down to a  di-di-rall when uh the role play or the role play yeah uh first situation like that so in a  situation like this the eye roll is not necessarily indicative of the dwarves are uh
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7871,like a hundred percent with you or against you it's not like make this check after all of this  RP in order to get what you want. This Dyral is more about them noticing his intent.  And for in this situation, his low roll here tells me that the dwarves are maybe a little
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7891,suspicious. He's talking about getting the hammer of Zorren and doing all these great things on  behalf of the dwarves. And maybe the dwarves are thinking like, well, this guy's talking a big  game because he wants something from us. I'm like, is he honest about his intentions here?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7906,So it's not so much like a, um, a,  maybe you should do an insight. I could see if I'm honest.  I understand what you're saying. Thank you. As, as always, your, your superior DME does not.  Oh, don't, that's not going to get you anywhere.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7924,I mean, it will, it will keep it up. Yeah. Thank you.  Right. So they look at you. They're thinking about this offer you've made them. And Grim  Gore gets up from his chair and he takes a couple steps towards you and he says, the hammer of Zorin
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7950,is the most prized artifact of all my people. We do not invoke its name lightly nor should  you. If you are suggesting that you would go on a holy and righteous quest to bring  back the sacred artifact of Seor and deliver it into my hands. I would like you to say it
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,7982,with panache. And he kind of motions to your knee and says, kneel and swear an oath to Seor,  of crafting and to a stare, God of law and order, that this is your true goal.  I'll do that.  Wait, why? I turned onto my party. I'm not trying to hide anything. I just turned onto my party.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8014,I think, oh, it's very seriously. Is everyone okay with this?  Ahjah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah  Why no? We discussed this before.  Yes.  If we's gonna bring backs the Big Tammers for the Dwarfs,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8028,we ain't getting no acts in return.  We getting whole dwarf.  You ask for whole dwarf.  What do you mean?  What do you mean?  That is true, from his very wise.  Remember that our goal is to ally with your
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8041,does the dance.  Well, I did say that too, though, that we want then them in the  the idea of the exchange right now is an axe handle for a fucking artifact of holy god rule.  We need to clarify that. We can take an oath to be an alliance with the dwarves forever like and
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8063,unite them once and for all. That's how big this is. Yeah, I mean, I'll specify that, but I  thought that was a deal already. Well, I already I already said that when I first talked to him,  I was like, and I wanted you to join our alliance.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8075,Okay.  And would you for this also join our alliance in full?  All them doors.  If you bring us the hammer,  I shall unite the Dwarven clans,  and I shall rule them and join with you,  the people of Yaka in a mutual alliance of trust, honor, and companionship.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8113,Okay.  And Kugabos too?  The people of Yaka.  Yabo Yaka too.  The Gabbos of Yaka.  I kneel and I hold out Boo and then I say,  then to you Grimgor, Boo's to you and to your crafting God.  I swear that we will attempt to bring you back to Hummer to aid you in this quest of
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8139,uniting all the dwarves and joining our empire.  Grimgor steps forward and then I hold out my harm like this, I guess, to your husband.  He, I guess you're on one knee, but you're still probably a little bit taller than him, so he clasps up to you on your knee and
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8158,brings you in for a very bro-y hug.  Lots of like slapping on the back and coughing and then stepping away, not being too close to each other, but you know.  Social distancing. Yeah.  Dipping practice and for generations.  Well, then we shall forge a hammer for your sword. You're a handle for your sword. It will take some time to match the quality that we see here. But when it is done, we shall place it into your hands if you yet live.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8195,and  On top of this grim lore, we are aware that there is a  Un or a closed  Cave entrance in the war arm range mountains that would make it easier to travel between Yaka and Ayu  We are also attempting to make them join our alliance and we would like to help clear out the tunnels
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8220,to open and increase trade  Great.  Yours get free tunnel.  As my advisors have told me, it seems you have struck a tenuous deal to clear out Langport  of any monsters that may reside within, thereby allowing my people to reclaim their place.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8249,I would agree to that.  fabulous deal.  That sounds amazing.  And I think we are still very interested to see what sort of art advice you would have  for trade if we do not keep the sword ourselves.  If you learn one thing about dwarves, if you learn two things about dwarves today, young
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8273,man, know that dwarves always keep their promises and always honor their oaths.  And a second, we're very sentimental about the things we hold dear.  There are few dwarven treasures we would be glad to part with, even for something of
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8296,this spectacular.  But remember, we will be acting as ambassadors of your people and trying to bring back the  hammer.  Well, the more powerful we become,  it will be no easy undertaking to take on a deep spot.  We are trying to become stronger
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8316,and harnessing our might every day.  Let me put it in a way that perhaps a human mind can grasp.  Perhaps you might.  Do you have,  I don't know if I can do that.  Do you have a favorite shirt,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8333,The shirts that you've had for 10 or 20, that's a long time, right?  Years.  Grab starts about zippered down.  A shirt that has been with you since childhood.  Would you trade that for a fine, expensive smoking jacket?  Even though your childhood t-shirt is worthless to anyone but you?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8355,One time I had a shirt.  I got to start talking.  One time I had a shirt and I wanted the shirt and then they said, we have to give the shirt  away to the Alfie guy to get the bow and then Grub had to give his shirt away but Grub really
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8366,loved that shirt and Grub was real sad so Grub knew exactly what you're talking about right now.  And Grub had to give away that shirt because the mean guy over there that never says nothing,  he has that he wanted to get no bow thing and so Grub had to give away shirt but Grub have
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8379,new shirt you like it? Splendid. Thanks! Hey! Also big boss king man.  You like this one so an orc walks into a  dwarven club he takes 15 damage  you've taken Sperage for that yes I've been waiting for that for fucking two
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8410,games oh no that's just for Devin not for the rest of you guys damn it I tell  Jeff is so good I group inspire the party.  No, it's just Devan's inspiration.  You guys got to back to Yaka if you want to get it
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8422,or do something particularly inspirational of your own.  Like all this amazing role-playing ending.  It takes me a lot of time to write those jokes.  You know what, we did just negotiate a pretty big deal.  You can have inspiration as well, but not for the rest.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8437,Okay.  Well, it sounds like everything is wrapped up.  The minutiae of the details can be mapped out between all of you right now about how you'll get to where you need to go and when things will happen.  Sounds like they'll take them a couple weeks probably to come up with a good design plan for the handle and yada yada.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8455,And they got to get to the right person to make it. It's bitch.  They tell you that they have an entrance to the you guys can see the world map right.  an exit to the mountains up here and that laying port used to exist right there.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8473,You can see those four-ven exits here and here. So in theory you could go across one jungle tile,  hop into dwarf town, cruise through the dwarven mines, cross another one jungle tile,  and then after going through a few more dwarven mines just go down this short river segment
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8492,and over to IU. That would make this trek instead of having to do, you know, 30 or 40 mixes.  It's really nice. You can do it in like 15.  Well, and it's very safe. Very safe. Perhaps the safest trading route of all.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8515,Hey, and yeah, how come you closed places first place what there  An outpost we would trade with the people of Shang before it fell to darkness  What how darkness stopped nothing darkness just night  Darkness is a metaphor goblin for all the animals of the world the monsters
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8542,Ahhh. Billings. The people with dark and twisted hearts who put greed for their brethren.  Like the psychic monkey we killed.  Ah, how many years ago was that? That shank fell.  Let's see.  I wasn't yet born.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8572,Maybe 400?  500?  Three hundred and fifty?  Four or five hundred years ago.  We would have to ask a very, very ancient dwarf if the precise states matter to you.  Well, when he's when he shuts down the places, how comes?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8598,Because no more businesses or is there because there's the big twisted heart thing there?  Like you says.  I did not understand you.  You shut down place because no more stuff to get there or because they're big bad guy
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8618,there.  Both?  Ah, what kind of big bag guy there?  All of them?  How many of them?  I don't understand you.  Oh, best to remove the map a bit to the left.  Why not?  Does it matter?  Yeah, because if we as goings,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8646,to clears out the big baddies,  Don't you think he's got to know how many baddies there are?  When we last left the...  When we last left Langport,  we closed its doors and closed doors behind it,  sealing off miles and miles of tunnel,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8663,because we were no longer going to use that.  There was no particular threat at the time,  but it has been hundreds of years.  And undoubtedly, something has found that place  that time. Maybe it's nothing. Maybe it's just mice or piercers. Maybe it's a black dragon.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8686,Who knows? Chances are something will be there.  So nothing stays unburied for too long.  Nothing that they had to trade with?  In terms of like greater artifacts?  Yeah, I mean, right. Or other magical items.  Yeah, they seem pretty resistant to trading anything that they already have.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8709,When we see they've got anything on hand, I don't really think so.  They're pretty happy.  Um, is there something that you might want that isn't exactly gear?  Is there something else you might want from the dwarves?  Yeah, I was gonna handle this as a side detail, but how about instead of an arming sword,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8734,It's a rape year. Can you uh, reforged that a bit?  No. Once forged and imbued with magic, it can never be reshaped.  This will be an arming sword until it is no more.  Yeah, that's what I was asking because I would make it uh, wouldn't that make it a dex weapon?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8754,Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Well, maybe we can swap it for something later.  What about we chop it in half and make it a short sword?  The dwarf tortles at your joke.  And we have happened to come by a lot of dragon skills
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8773,from killing more dragons.  Wonder if this is something that would interest you  to forge armor. We could shape, we may be able to shape dragon scales into armor. I will not
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8806,speak on behalf of our smiths without consulting them directly.  Well, how about that we leave you with the dragon skills and the flaming sword,  and we attempt our best to go out in the world, gain power, and obtain the hammer for you?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8829,Mm.  Well, I believe we have a deal.  The rest of the stuff you guys can work out  and they will help get you transported  through the mountains.  You'll have to cross one hex here  and then through the other mountains.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8848,So someone will roll me a Duke 20,  make sure we don't have any accounts all the way.  I think I want a petition for a brief deed for Tiyaka.  I want them to start building a road that way.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8858,Nice.  It's my idea.  Okay.  Yeah, you guys can do a brief trip to Yaka.  Someone give me a D20 for crossing the jungle.  Oh, also side note while we have the king's attention.  Can we get some sort of seal,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8873,which lets us get through these tunnels for free?  Oh, it's fine.  We're going to be doing a lot for you.  It's a physical seal.  We need a piece of your tunnels.  Do you have some sort of seal that will allow us access?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8889,Yes.  He will get you.  You miss every shot, you don't take it.  One such thing.  It's an old dusty piece of jade that they present you with.  And it looks like they very intentionally not dusted it before handing it to you.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8907,It sits maybe...  the length of my cell phone and about the height of it too,  but same depth as the height.  So it's a big rectangular block of green jade.  The bottom of which is carved in a pattern,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8927,and the top of which is sort of flat  with a little bit of decorative relief on it.  The relief around the edges  seemed to be some sort of like  Celtic not-stonework combination,  and on the bottom appear to be some sort of
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8942,Dwarven runes, Dwarven carvings,  it's some sort of pictographical depiction of  who the fuck knows.  It is beautiful, thank you.  Okay.  Of course, this will only work for the people  who are carrying it.  You wouldn't be able to share between
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8962,different groups of people.  All right.  Two will get you guys back to Yaka.  You can arrive in town after being gone for so very long.  Everyone gets inspiration for walking past the Savior's statues.  And it has been...  How long has it been, Grub, since you guys have been here?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,8987,Um...  One three weeks?  Wait, yeah.  We were here a while ago, right?  pretty recently. Been a while. We got to go talk to all the hosers and see how our  empire is doing, right? It's actually been quite a while because we still
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,9002,traveled all the way to Haiyu. Yeah, I think ballpark timing would be one month.  I guess three weeks to the other since that's about right. All right. You arrived back home.  You are greeted by guards. You are given dates and fruits, a little bit of fruit wine as well
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,9020,and brought to a place where you can rest before you will meet up with the leaders of Yaka.  How in character of me?  Is there something that you wanted to do other than ask them to start building a road?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,9037,Was there something you wanted to RP out at all?  I'm just glad it's not on fire.  Oh, I think that's about it.  I mean, we want to ask them like how they're doing and like, I mean, I guess they're just kind of like a shadow council that just manages stuff while we do shit, right?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,9055,They do all the day to day management, all the boring, like, oh, they ran out of wood over here, let's send some more lumberjacks, and they oversee the religious matters and the spiritual matters.  They actually get to live the life of Yaka while you guys are off in the woods doing crazy shit all the time and are sort of you know
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,9077,You are the people may be doing the most good on the long-term scale for your town, but you're also the least connected to your town  Is there anything we would need to do like CEO Andy style like where we'd have to go in and ask like how management is going and like and like figure out
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,9092,Yeah.  Is that worth it?  No, not really.  Cool.  Think of yourselves more as like the like the Navy seals of Yaka.  You do the important shit, but like you don't actually have any authority to dictate how  the city should be run.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,9106,And technically, even though you could probably kill them all in a heartbeat, like the council  is your superior within the social structure.  Got it.  If that makes sense.  Okay.  We're just saying it's cool.  Yeah, for now.  Oh, okay.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,9120,I mean, they know things.  I'm 20 20.  You weren't trapped 20 20.  So you mentioned the flaming sword to anyone here?  I don't think we have a reason to, right?  All right.  I just think the primary thing to mention is one length of road here and then one
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,9146,the length of road here.  They'll work out the details on how to get  the wood past the doors.  Yeah, they will talk amongst themselves.  And when you leave, you'll hear massive arguments  about the impracticalities of building a road
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,9160,and how it leaves too many people out in the jungle  for too long.  And with the rainstorms that come,  you need to be repairing the road all the time.  And so what else saying, you know,  but look at all the good it could do, isn't it worth it?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,9170,Besides, haven't we built up this power base?  If you know, what's the point of building an empire  if we can't even maintain the empire,  are thinking too small and there are political problems,  but that is not your job to sort out.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,9183,I'll make some dice rolls on the side  and we'll see how it comes out.  And the next time you're around here,  it'll be underway, completed or rejected,  and you'll have to set a bit straight.  So I think before, I don't think we're quite ready
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,9200,to fight the Deep Sun, of course, is yet.  How about we go down southeast  and go to Necro.  Once you're going to...  Yeah, I'm going to go.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  After that.  After that.  Cool.  All right.  Well, why don't we take our break here?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,9219,And when we come back from our break,  we will transport you guys to this area.  All right.  Alright, we're gonna break.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,9257,you
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,9287,you
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,9317,you
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,9347,you
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,9377,you
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,9407,you
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,9437,you
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,9467,you
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,9497,you
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,9527,you
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,9557,you
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,9587,you
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,9617,you
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,9647,you
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,9677,you
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,9707,you
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,9737,you
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,9767,Hello?  You're muted.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  Damn it.  Hello, everybody.  Welcome back to Empire's  Oh, lovely and lovely.  I'm so happy you've done on this.  Oh, right.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,9797,I'm glad I grabbed the quarter staff from Yaka.  Easy peasy.  You got a quarter staff.  All right.  Some days later, you find yourself in the dwarven minds.  You have been led in the traditional manner  and taken to this area.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,9814,Well, actually on the verge between these two hexes.  There is a great stone wheel that has been rolled in place  across the opening here.  And the dwarves stand before it.  There's an aged wench here, that will be used
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,9833,to pull back the stone and the guards walking with you  wanna make one thing very clear.  They're gonna open this.  It's gonna make a bunch of noise.  They're gonna let the four of you through  and then they're gonna close it
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,9851,and that's gonna make a bunch of noise.  They have a cleric on hand who will keep an eye on you  from time to time with a clairvoyance spell.  And when it seems like you guys have done  what you need to do and you've opened the tunnel
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,9867,to the outside, then they will open this door  and come on through.  But otherwise, if something's in here,  they wanna keep their section  Quarantined and under lockdown  Boo is ready to dispatch of any enemy. Yeah, this sounds like some trained to bass on shit. I don't know about that
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,9887,I have an alternate proposal. Could you clear voice in right now and tell us what's in there?  When we clear voice it must be in a fixed place we would be able to see maybe one room  How you know where we are then?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,9913,You have the great axe.  We can find it.  Okay, I have a second proposal.  I have no doubt in our success, but it is always wise to have a backup plan.  Suppose we are in retreat and we come back here.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,9931,we knock on this door and will you open it for us. If you are in retreat against something you cannot  kill, we will not then let it into our section of the tunnels. That's sort of the point.  I add.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,9952,What if you open it enough for the others to escape and I will stay behind and hold it back so that  it cannot come out with us.  Hey, closing we have a five minute head starter.  I want to do, I want to do like a, I don't know if this is intimidation or whatever.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,9967,It's not, it's not going to be like aggressive.  It's going to be like, what?  Me think that doors be strongest.  They always say and dwarf too scared to fight big baddie.  You decide what kind of check it is.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,9982,I don't know.  I think that's a persuasion check.  Let's put it this way.  This stone wall, this stone wheel is thick.  You could pound on the other side for days  and we might not notice that you're there.  We will clear Voyance in on you from time to time.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10004,Should the narrow chance happen  that you are actively fleeing at a great distance  from a creature and about to arrive at the door.  Perhaps then we will be able to open it.  Or perhaps not what if you are being chased by an invisible creature.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10025,We can see you but not hear you. We would have no way of knowing.  For the safety of our people, we will close this door once we open it.  And we will not open it again until we are assured that everything on the other side is safe.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10041,Well, if there's zombie back there.  Well, then you made a bad deal because you agreed to this.  Oh, you guys a bunch of fucking cowards? The dwarves seem to be...  I'm ready.  I'm not scared in any way. I'm never scared.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10055,All right. I like to hear all this through.  My friend Corin does not have emotions.  You have to pull on the winch and you can hear the loud sound of stone scraping on stone as the wheel  rolls back enough for the four of you to slip through.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10073,The dwarves will toss a couple of baskets along with you,  containing food, just in case you guys need it,  and let you in.  If there's a troll around there, I'm out the forring.  Okay.  In real life.  Just like.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10086,I was like,  then,  ragdoll.  Orgown this map, orgown this.  Yeah.  Yeah, you are moving into here.  Before you is a long tunnel.  And if this is keeps his axe out,  you will have 60 feet of bright light.  That was a basically one of your ways of tunnel.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10114,Yeah.  You started somewhere in here.  You're not exactly sure where it was, but you know,  about it.  All right.  You proceed forward following this shaped stone path  for miles upon miles.  Can I get a stealth check from,  whoever's got the lowest stealth in the party?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10138,Only me.  Well, take a weakest link.  Two?  Anyone have less than two stealth?  Minus eight, son of a.  I think it's you.  Is it eight, seven?  And, Grub, what's your stealth?  Seven, six.  It's high as hell. Eight, seven, six, two.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10162,All right.  Eleven's not bad.  Do you guys manage to keep it fairly quiet and fairly still?  And after many, many miles, you come to a break in the carved wall  wall where it looks like something has gone from left to right and broken down the stone walls and there are dirt corridors
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10182,Extending in either direction. Well while we're walking here  I just want to make sure that we're looking up as well in case that's not a natural thing for our sister  Dude, so I want to clear out this cave
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10191,Yeah, the passageway is about 10 feet wide 10 feet tall  So you can keep an eye above you and just looking forward will cover the ceiling as well. I  I do want a perception check from you as well.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10204,Mink's.  All right.  You notice no other details along the way  that would be of interest to you,  but you have come to this passageway  where something has burrowed in  from one of these two sides to your left  is just a small little chamber,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10222,maybe 25 feet across, maybe 15 feet down.  Not much to see there.  On the right side, however, is a passageway  that twists and turns and you lose sight of it  after maybe 100 feet.  And then there is the shape stone that goes before you.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10242,Okay, so recap left is a room  and it's supposed to be a room?  Left is just sort of a dead end.  Like whatever was tunneling through here,  stop tunneling over there.  Oh, so if you were to look to left like 20 feet,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10256,it just dead ends.  It just dead ends, yeah.  Strange, okay.  I take one of my many glowstones  and I toss it 20 feet that side.  To the left side?  Yep.  Roles into the room illuminating it  that kind of dips down in the middle
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10275,and rises up on the top.  You can't actually see if the very top of the room  has anything unusual about it  unless you would work to walk into the room.  And I'm using room very loosely here.  Okay.  I think you should go explore it.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10291,Well, I don't want to get eaten by whatever is up there.  Do you want me to go explore it?  I think we should have our bowman, our archer, get ready to shoot whatever is up there.  Sure.  I can ready an attack.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10308,Why do we think something's up there?  Well, there's all that we can do.  It's going to be dead end here, right?  It makes sense. I will go first. I'm the strongest.  OK. I very stealthily and carefully.  Can I already a rage?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10333,Yes.  So like if I'm about to be attacked, I rage basically.  Yes.  Okay, sweet.  Yeah, I like going.  All right, you walk forward and it's just a regular ceiling.  It's just a little higher than everything else.  Ah!  All right.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10353,Oh, good caution.  I grabbed my stone from me.  This must have been made by some sort of giant worm.  I agree.  So in order to,  in order to make this tunnel safe,  I suppose we will have to dispatch the worm.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10372,Hmm.  Maybe this is where it sleeps.  We could try waiting here for a little bit.  I think that it probably just held here,  and then got bored and then decided to tunnel somewhere else.  We can continue exploring.  Well, we found the thing we need to kill.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10394,So there is no need-  But I mean, I explore to find it.  Why don't we look around for warm juice?  Sure, it's that way.  I point towards the other side.  If it's a trip path, if it's it.  So is there any like, wouldn't it be like wet on the walls
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10411,if it had been there recently?  Can I look at that?  Yeah, give me an investigation check to search for clues.  Shaggy.  Oh, there's nothing wet about these walls.  You look around, this cave section here actually looks pretty old.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10431,It doesn't look recently made.  The section on the left where you are right now has no real tracks of any kind on it other  than what you've brought in with you and is extraordinarily bland and boring.  hit yeah it's just a dead end rub takes out his sword and hits the wall give me an attack roll
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10457,I don't know how I don't do that uh hey  hang on open your character sheet I did it yeah you hit the wall roll me damage  roll you damage yeah  nine okay  Yeah.  You do nine damage to the wall.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10477,Oh, we could kill the wall.  Wait, he does a full nine damage to the wall.  Yeah, he does nine points of damage to the wall.  That was a bad.  Your sword sinks into the earth,  comes out dirty and nasty.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10490,Wall crumbles a little bit before you.  What is the wall made of?  Just earth.  Okay, because I thought attacking stuff like that  normally was that it has like resistance.  Like if we're fighting like stone gargoyles and stuff,  half damage not full damage I mean it's just a regular wall I'm just fucking
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10506,with you guys well if you're saying we do damn it you're saying we do full  damage maybe it's not a regular wall maybe something else is going on here  maybe there is keep attacking it I do wait what are you doing stop huh what if
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10521,the wall is a wormy what if you collapse the tumble on us what you mean I think  That is more likely.  This place isn't the place that was built.  Listen, if Grub inside a worm, Grub went out.  What we are not inside a worm.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10540,How you know?  You want to be inside dirt?  Grub inside dirt right now.  You will be if you keep hitting this wall.  Oh, that's not good.  But that's very bad.  Yeah, very bad.  Let's find this worm and slay it.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10557,It's gonna come attack us soon with all this use is bickering.  Well, bring it to a map because this apparently is quite confusing.  There we are.  Can you see?  Yes, burn cave.  Yeah, a little bit.  All right, so you guys have been coming up from the bottom and you have this area
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10590,And you were about to poke right when the wall became very interesting to you  I love you.  You're good.  That's so funny.  Okay.  What?  I'll tell you when you're older.  Okay.  Well, I guess we can like continue down to these.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10622,Okay.  You take the right passageway and it go,  we don't have to go down it right now,  but it will turn and twist and curve and go downhill  and then start going uphill like a lot  and it'll kind of corkscrew and wind
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10639,and move in strange directions  and you find yourself losing what was forward  and what was backwards, what was left and right,  but you are definitely going uphill.  were climbing up into the mountains higher and higher.  Well, we didn't want to go that far, right?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10656,Because we're supposed to be on this big path.  You can go back if you want.  Yeah, we're supposed to clear it.  We're literally just falling a worm trail.  Like we should just go back.  Yeah.  How many minutes?  Maybe this result.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10670,How many months so far?  I think 15 minutes of hiking.  I think we want to put on a one hour limit  on following this trail.  How do we know how to get back?  Yeah, like straight four miles or something. Yeah, people three and a half miles for we have any trouble getting back
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10687,It's a straight shot. I mean, it's not actually it's a  Two-dimensional path  Wait, we're not worried that we're walking down a tunnel that a worm is eaten and it's just gonna come back to this way and eat us
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10698,I mean, that's what we're here for it to kill while that is in this tunnel  We don't know if it's in the tunnel. It might have just pieced out  It might have  We should find this and then like get ready to collapse this entire thing
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10708,why don't we just collapse it now oh cuz it can dig cuz it's a little first yeah  yeah I guess we have to kill it in so what is the marching order down this 10-foot  wide passageway I got first in front do you have any information grab on giant
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10725,worms yes yes there are jungle worms within the mountains give me a nature  check and I'll tell you what you know about him.  Rob knows a lot.  Grub, what do you know about jungle worms?  I'm going to guidance myself, too.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10746,Grub touches his forehead.  16.  No, no what no no you don't have guidance permanently cast on your soul  You can't be like, huh?  I want to...  Oh, I remember now.  Good, now I remember.  If you want to guide someone,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10776,I never thought you'd be able to have me order athleticism.  If you're like, we're about to undertake this thing,  let's do it, that's totally sweet.  But when you're just kind of like, huh,  do I remember this shit?  What are you doing?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10787,Slapping yourself upside the face  when you want to cast guidance  every time you remember something?  Yes!  What did you have for breakfast?  Guidance!  Yay!  That's your moment.  Yeah!  We did it!  Guidance is not like, I'm a druid.  Everyone gets an extra D4
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10800,on all of their skill checks no matter what.  It's exactly what it says.  Go dumb.  No, that's what it says.  I don't wanna play that way.  It's a dumb way to play that game.  It's so, it's not fun.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10811,It basically gives everyone plus two and a half  to literally everything all the time,  which is sort of just like the greatest buff  that you could ever get.  And it's just free, it's dumb.  It's stupid.  It's not a good way to play.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10821,Grub would 100% do that.  He would go knock on his head,  hit a rock against the wall,  and then figure something out.  It's insight.  You bring insight from nature, man.  Are you gonna divide the nature's peers?  If there's like an active situation
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10834,where you are about to attempt something of significance  that I am so down with this,  I feel like, hey, I wanna walk across that bridge,  but it looks dangerous, that seems fine.  But like trying to recall things or remember things,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10847,I don't know about that.  That seems sketchy.  I hate it.  I hate it so much.  Is it technically an ability check?  is technically a skill check, which is an ability check.  Yeah, sure.  I know what the spell says.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10863,I'm saying that the rules are dumb.  I'm saying the rule is dumb, and we shouldn't play that way,  even if the game says that's the way that we should play.  Well, you're taking, you've already  taken healing spirit from me.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10877,You're taking, now you're taking my cantrip.  What?  I'm not taking your cantrip.  What are you?  mildly restricting it so it isn't used in passive checks  or like when you're negotiating with some king,  be like, hold on, he's about to need to say something important.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10894,Let me slap him on the ass before he talks, right?  Right?  I just wanted to be used a little bit more,  you know, intuitively, a little bit more mechanically,  a little bit more like we are here for this thing.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10907,Let's try this thing hard rather than just like,  hold on, no one's saying anything  because the DM asked for a skill check.  And so now my character is going to make an action  because there's a random skill check somewhere.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10917,You know what I'm saying?  Do you understand the difference between  a character's decision to do something  and like the random skill checks that come  when you're playing D&D  because the DM asks you to remember something?  Right, like if I ask you for a perception check
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10930,while you walk down a hallway,  you're not gonna be like,  hold on, let me guidance myself first.  Cause this perception check is indicative  of like the general awareness over a period of time  rather than a specific instance of need.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10941,It's similarly, this is sort of like a general,  well, what do you know about these worms?  Not so much like, hey, remember that one thing  that that one guy said that we're all trying to figure out  and we can't remember?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10951,Maybe give me some magical ability  to remember this one specific thing this one time.  You know what I'm saying?  What is the magic that guides guidance to you?  What is it? What is it?  What is it do?  What does the spell do for you?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10964,What does it do to you?  DM hacks.  What's your bullshit?  You gotta do better.  Like in a role-play sense, what do you think it's doing  to give you that ability?  Is it from the divine?  Is it from the God?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10975,It's your world, right?  It's a divine.  So it's a divine spell.  I think it's only available to divine casters.  And so it's essentially like a cleric or a druid  giving someone the blessing of a deity to perform better.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,10989,It's a like a temporary sacred,  the gods are gonna help you out with this a little bit.  Okay, so I'm literally-  well in instances not over times or general concepts.  Then make it area of effect.  I think like, I think, so from what I know of guidance.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11007,Actually, it feels to me like this is like something  that would be pretty comparable to like Bardic inspiration.  You wouldn't really like,  vertically inspire somebody to remember something,  but like if we were to play this as written, right,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11018,then you could theoretically,  if you had a bard and a druid on your team,  you could cast a Bardic inspiration and guidance  on the same ability check just to remember things,  seems like it would be kind of funny, right?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11027,Mm-hmm. That is as the rules say.  Yeah, but as the rules say, I should have crossbow expert and a whole lot of other cool shit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's why it all fucks me out of.  Do you want to play the fun game or like the game as it's written?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11041,The real meme should be that we're sitting in front of each other and then when we asked,  do we know anything about worms,  we would say, well, do you? And then you can't actually roll for knowledge at all.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11049,You just have to have knowledge of whatever it is, which would require reading in advance, whatever, right?  right? All right well I wasn't going to because I was going to just rely on  a ground rule role but do you want us all to roll? Like it would give us four times
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11064,the chances right? That is another issue of this I was gonna just leave it to you  but then you asked Grub so I'm happy to let Grub roll it but if you want to roll  it that's fine I'll allow a couple of checks on this stuff okay you would
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11078,usually prefer from like the most knowledgeable one person rather than  giving it a check to everyone.  So when you have like 20 people who have never heard  of a jungle worm before for any particular reason,  chances are almost 20.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11089,Somebody rolls a nat 20.  Yeah, so I prefer to leave it to like the person  with the highest or in a situation where the lowest,  where it's the weakest length,  the person with like the lowest stat for,  so for stealth I asked the lowest person for nature,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11102,I would ask the person with the highest nature.  That makes sense.  Okay.  Mm.  That was good to me.  Let's see what we're on those about.  Wait, what did we decide about guidance?  You cannot use it for like a hard time.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11119,For this general random stuff.  But if there's something that you're like,  hey, I actually wanna spend a bonus action,  no, full action on this.  It's something I'm really working on,  then that seems more fair.  But not just like Willy Nilly over general periods.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11136,Okay, can I, and are you gonna make an area effect?  No.  Can I petition to replace my cantrip given these new circumstances if I so choose?  No.  You change the rules on me and then you make me keep it.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11149,That's the fucking bullshit.  What the fuck is this?  That's nonsense, dude.  That's ridiculous.  I'm, that's, I am, I object.  Your objection is noted.  I am the Senate.  Only a Sith deals and absolutes  Wait, what would you I'm just gonna I think you should be able to apply to the cantra
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11174,That is true because rules as written if we're if we're accident now  You should probably be able to swap out the cantra, right?  And it's still an extremely powerful spell all the time the nerf is mild  very mild in fact in how many sessions of this 15 sessions 20 sessions the nerf has come up
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11192,Once okay, but hold on how many sessions as he remembered?  He's had the ability to be like me.  I remember it twice and it's come up once.  The 50% of our uses of guidance have been there.  Okay.  That's making me, you're making me keep it literally on principle
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11209,because you know, because you feel like you did it  nerf it enough to deserve me to give it up.  All right, you've convinced me.  Replace it right now.  You can do it, buddy.  I want, I want a choice.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11221,I want to think about it.  Oh my God.  All right.  Think you're going to be a part of the water.  OK, thank you.  Thank you.  I rest my case.  All right.  With a 12 on your nature check, you have learned.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11235,Do you know jungle worms are big and they're scary  and they'll fuck you up?  That's about it.  They're green, too.  Rob, do you have a sense of if a jungle worm is tougher  than a trollaroo?  Like, that's a yes.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11248,They are tougher?  Yeah, I think stays tougher.  Oh, I would have liked to know about that before we followed this trail. Let's go back. You should have asked  Well, wait a second. Isn't that what we're here to do? Oh
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11264,Close up this tunnel  I drum could you do that for us?  Hold on we're gonna close up the tunnel full of dirt so that the worm that eats dirt  Can't get back into the passageway  This is what will happen. The worm is going to come back and it is going to kill all the dwarves
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11284,It is going to kill anyone that is trading at the time and we will be responsible  We are very strong. We have Corin over here with a stupid amount of arrows. I have this axe and  Zai can just stun the bloody thing and it can't move
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11302,We will be fine and Devin can just transform into a gorilla and seduce it.  Maybe I can transform into a worm instead, isn't it?  I appreciate your confidence, but there are some things in this world that we are not ready to fight yet.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11318,One of them is Deep Spawn, one of them is Forest Worm. We should close up this tunnel.  Well, hold on a second. Why would we agree to come into a tunnel like this? We're not ready to fight a worm.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11328,What are we gonna do if this worm shows up and just starts slaughtering the dwarves as soon as we claim we've cleared the tunnel?  I think we just closed tunnel and then worm no breathe and it died.  So there are worms throughout this area.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11345,It randomly eating into a tunnel is a risk, but...  We not even know if worms still here. Maybe Worm find new home.  Oh.  Exactly.  These tunnels look very, very old  and a natural part of the terrain now.  So, Grub, can you move some dirt for us?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11369,You want speed to close.  Well, okay.  I think, maybe, Corin's right.  Because what happens if we close whole tunnel  and then, Wurmi comes in after doors.  They're like, hey, everything cool and it's not cool.  And then the doors are like, you said it was cool.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11382,And we're like, oh, sorry, in a knuckle.  That worm could eat anywhere through the tunnel.  Worms are just a very real threat of all tunnels,  which I think is true.  Yeah, that's true.  And then Dorsnott know.  Good point.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11395,OK, yeah, we close it.  I think that good idea.  We're one mile in.  I think if we start closing it from here on out,  then we have one mile dirt between us  and any potential worms.  Perfect.  What if it's already in the rest of the mountain?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11415,What if it is the wall?  What if we're in a worm now?  We should be ready to fight it either way.  All right, really?  When the cavern opens up before you into a larger room.  Oops, you belong over here, Zai.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11444,You all see that?  Yep.  It is quiet in here, but you have definitely entered a new section of the tunnels.  Does all of this area still look like, well, before this cavern, was this all looking like  it was dug up by a worm perhaps, if I were to just make a guess?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11475,Sure.  It's some sort of natural carving through regular earth and a little bit of rock here and there.  Yeah, not like handmade duck.  Hand tooling.  Yeah.  Okay.  This would be the place to start filling it up.  I don't believe we have any reason to explore further.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11496,Rob, would you do the honors?  What you want me to do?  Move dirt, fill tunnel.  I'm not going to do that.  I'm not going to do that.  No.  Why grub do that?  Grub no special.  I'm doing that.  What?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11512,I thought you didn't you do that  before against the goblins.  I changed my cancer for another  one.  Do what?  No, that was me.  I think about my old character.  That was new.  That was that dead guy we used to
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11526,know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Grub can't do that.  Grub just grub.  Why don't you punch it real hard?  Well then I suppose we have no choice but to  see what may be in here and perhaps punch it.  Punch it real hard.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11544,I'm ready.  I want to just call out to see if there's anything in here and have them come to us.  I would rather hope that it was sleeping and that we could ambush it.  Okay, well then let's move in.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11557,Wait!  Grab have question.  Okay.  If we fight big troll and it kill us all,  and we fight bigger worm, which is more gobble his total,  and it kill us all while we fight worm.  I am stronger than your previous teammates.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11581,Well, no, that is a very good point.  If we see a big worm, we should run away.  That is all.  Okay.  We all agree we leave or we fight.  It's a big worm than we leave.  How do we know that it's more dangerous?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11601,Grub nose.  Do you?  Yeah.  Yeah, I asked him whether or not it was more dangerous than a trolleroon.  The answer was very yes.  The answer was apparently it's not even close.  Trollaroo our trollaroos as scary to us now as they were when we were a party of four level threes. What's up? I see something
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11621,There is something before you it is  How do I show to it looks? I'm just gonna drag it over here. This is not an actual token the fuck is that that?  Yeah  Let me give you maybe a better picture
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11637,Sure.  Devin, you can start shivering now.  Is this too scale?  What the fuck?  No, this is not to scale.  It is a green insect-like creature.  Looks like that.  Oh, fuck.  My life for Iyer.  And it looks at you.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11661,It's a two-e thing.  to be saying it's a  this is a little bad and then it  lunges forward and we should roll initiative  it's an anchor I think to  the end of the mark  how do you know this
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11678,for the two that's where it means to come  have  Bystat  of  our firstv
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11709,and hasn't attacked you yet.  So you don't want it to, if it went off right now,  then you can lose it because you want initiative.  No, that's fair.  Okay.  So the party goes.  Okay, I raid and move up.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11725,Oh, actually, Tormundrend Roar!  All right.  Unveiling of the weapon.  Yeah, all right.  I summon my my Tormund Ren inside its goal.  Excellent.  You roll a 15 to hit and then an eight, but the 15 does hit the creator.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11749,You will.  21 damage.  And for 21, a tremendous blow that brings it down to about half hit points right away.  Matt  anyone else will take an action  that  they ,  I'm an attorney  to a giant
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11783,sentiments of the title of the first  22 to hit. I don't have advantage for any reason. Nope. Shot two is a 17. Two hits.  Seven damage plus nine damage. 16. Barely alive. Okay.  Don't you want to roll like a superiority dice? You can kill it. Is that me? No, I'm okay.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11808,Why would I waste resources right now? We have Zai should go next.  Or you can cast a cantrip or whatever.  Somebody can do it right?  I don't think you need to shape change.  Yeah, there's literally no reason.  It's one small creature right now.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11820,I don't think I should move up either.  I think you should just burn it with your light light  and then wait, wait and see where the rest of them are.  So they all aggro on me.  I will burn it.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11832,What I ride punch it.  Actually, I whack at it and put first up.  You break its back.  insect creature, shrivels, kisses, crackles and dies.  Um, since I don't see anything, I try to like, look at the ground and see if anything's moving under us.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11852,Nope, just the weird fluids exuding from the creature's body.  Are you, uh, this cave, is this still like, ten feet tall? Like, it's a normal...  No, it's beginning to open up and be a lot wider and a lot taller.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11866,So right here it's maybe a 15, 20 feet tall.  What is here? Sorry, I can't see your pain.  Uh, where the arrow is pointing?  Oh, maybe I have it hidden from you.  You should be able to see this.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11877,The room that you're in.  Yeah. Oh God, I think my shit is...  You don't see my arrow?  Fucking up. I'm gonna refresh it.  I'm sorry. Something is weird.  Okay.  I can't control my character.  Nevermind.  Oh yeah, neither can I. Oh fuck, maybe I should have it.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11888,Yeah, you have to refresh it. It's bad.  Yeah. Roll 20...  I think with coronavirus running around,  everyone's hanging out on Roll 20 these days  and the servers are just like dying slowly but surely.  Okay.  I move up one then, right?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11909,Yeah, you can move up a few more feet.  All right.  And I think that is the end of your movement.  You get a little bit more movement actually.  We'll only move 25.  We'll move up to 40.  Okay.  I'm gonna move towards it
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11926,What's that effect on this that is his rage effect. Oh, okay  All right, I see one  All right, I see two honk eggs turn  The next one scuttles down some steps and over towards in front of you  there's three and
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11948,And then it spits acid or sprays acid in a line that is 30 feet long and 5 feet wide  Provided that it has no creature capital each creature not lying must make it you see 13  Xterity saving throw
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11962,So it will  Cue  skewer spewer spew  Acid like this through the two of you. Would you both make me dexterity saving throws minks?  Of course danger sense uncanny dodge whatever it's called gives you an extra  advantage on your save. Not so care. You will both pass and you will take half
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,11987,damage from this. 3, 4, and 6 is 13 divided by 2 is 6 damage to each of you and  makes you'll take another half because you're raging. So you each sizzle with  the acid burning on you. This guy, I should probably mark you as acid sprayed. This one
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12010,will scamper over here as well and get an acid spray. Ooh, not quite. We'll do it this  way then. We will just scamper to this tile. Nope, no, no, no, this one. And we can spray.  There is a tile where all three get hit. I'm trying to, I'm trying to take cover under
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12031,that thing that's why I moved there yeah and that's why he moved here is to try  and shoot you with his acid spray but I'm like hidden underneath that the alcove  I'll give you advantage on your save you've got a wall to press up against
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12046,that might be able to splash it aside good shit what's it with the three of  you give me dexterity saving arrows or suffer 10 points of damage pass pass  pass you each take five except for minx who takes two and this one has acid
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12066,sprayed and the last one will come on over to here standing with its friends  and acid spray the front two of you again give me another dexterity saving throw  Just the front two.  Uh, okay.  Oh my god.  Your saves are so high.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12089,Uh, it would be five, six, seven divided by two is three,  divided by two is one for Minsk.  Heh heh heh heh heh heh.  Okay.  Alright, party's turn.  Okay.  Um, hmm.  Grub is gonna go.  Become a giant snake
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12111,Up over here  Yeah, it's close enough yep, you will giant snake whoa grab us 30 feet of movement, right?  The snake has more  He transforms us what?  The snake has no 30 feet of movement. Okay. Never mind. Yeah
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12133,Yeah  so here  Or here?  Yeah, we do this.  It's awkward, right?  Because you don't want to be clipping too far into there.  I guess you could maybe clip them a little bit.  You are a snake. It's fine.  I'm going to put Grub Grub in the darkness.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12150,Um, if before he attacks, if I move here,  then we're both flanking, right?  Well, I'm trying to block Grub's token from seeing anything.  Magic, give me a moment.  I don't want him to see everything.  All right, if you yeah, now you're flanking the one dude. Yeah. Yeah
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12173,And I constrict it  Wait an annual HP red oh, yes, you've read yourself through the creature you have 80 12 plus eight for hit points  Fuck  Damn, that's a lot of HP  Wait, is it okay? It's not yeah, I I wrote two ones all right I
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12196,Could strict it I  Don't you try to grab it  But your new shapes changed snake form is a little slow to move  We haven't quite warmed up to being a snake and the oncag just kind of crawls all over you dripping little bits of acid on your shiny
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12211,Green scales  Minks flanks the oncag  Oh, I'm not kidding.  Fuck kicking for goodness.  Uh, 22, 27.  Wow.  Wait a minute, you're not bare totem warrior.  Are you?  Uh oh.  No.  You should have taken this.  Yeah.  So you're raged only reduces non magical bludgeoning slashing piercing damage, right?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12237,And also acid.  The player characters aren't the only one treating Twitch chat.  Watch out.  You should have taken the same damage as Trump.  Wait, what the fuck, guys?  You're supposed to be on our side.  I have 14.  What's going on here?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12250,Mutiny.  Six.  Man, that guy.  I have my sandwich.  Wait.  There we go.  There you go.  You should be at 40.  OK.  Yeah.  That's fine.  You hit.  I can't roll on the crit there.  Did I roll on one?  The crit rolled a 7 plus 4 and a 6.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12267,There should be an extra 16 on that one.  Roll me one.  Now you don't do extra deep crit damage to you.  That's another character, it's another campaign.  All right, yeah, so you do 20 and 17 damage to this.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12282,So 37.  Plus range damage.  37, all right, so another two?  No, four.  Okay, perfect.  Four? Okay, another, there we go.  Perfect.  Almost slangly on gag.  Okay, anyone else want to go?  Yeah, I'll go next.  So I'll move 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and I will start taking some attacks with this one. First one.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12311,21 is a hit for 5 points of damage which slays the oncag.  and then the top 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55.  I think I can just keep counting.  Let me hit this next one with a little number of stripes flanking.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12331,Not quite. He would need to be here, but 15 will hit.  I'm sure, 60.  You only have 55 feet of movement.  Oh, this had my limit, 55.  You've reached it.  card. I have a 15 hits anyway.  That is.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12354,Sorry, I'm not. You crack it in the back. It's  kiteness plating breaking open slightly.  Bottom creature. I'll take two shots. Yep. It's a large  creature, so minks doesn't really give it any cover.  Both of your shots will hit for 21 damage.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12375,Right. The onk eggs, turns, roll around.  Oops, that is not the right button. We want this button.  Neither of them recharge. This wounded one hisses cries out and will take a disengage action  and scamper down this tunnel over here, running that way.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12396,Okay.  This larger guy.  Do I not get an attack of opportunity?  He took a disengage action.  To full disengage, so.  Yep, so he like backs away from you,  hissing and like scrambling up those steps,  swiping at you with his front legs
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12411,until there's an opening for you for it to back out.  This next one will just come up  and bite the crap out of his eye.  With a 22 to hit,  it sinks its pincers into you  six slashing and four acid damage.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12426,Uh, I use Spirit Shield to reduce the damage by 2dc.  Ooh, go for it.  Is the music supposed to end?  Oh, it never meant it just changed.  Yeah, it's been made for me.  Roll 20 has been having a tough week.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12442,It's okay.  Yeah, you just take the four damage then.  Lovely.  And that is not the end of the onk eggs turn because directly above this spot here,  there is a hole in the ceiling.  You'll notice that this is like a lowered area
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12457,with kind of a rise around it.  We probably can't see that.  A rise around it over here like this.  That's because there's additionally  like another layer above you.  And it's dropping down from that layer  that we have two more onc eggs arriving on this turn.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12477,The first one will come over here to grab Zai.  The second one will come straight for the giant snake.  It'll bite the giant snake with a 21 to hit,  eating you for 16 damage,  and the other one will go after a zai.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12491,Ooh, does it have enough movement to do that?  It's probably about 10 to get here.  Yeah, it'll actually go all the way behind zai.  Flank him and bite him from the backside.  They 19 to hit.  Yep, I think that hits for 14 damage.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12508,Oh, it's okay.  And it becomes the PC's turn.  All right, and I think you have to take out the NK  that run away.  Take out the what?  There's one NK, like south of me.  I think you have to take it out so you can't ask it's first.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12524,Okay, hold on.  I don't know how much movement I have.  I'd have to get all the way over to you, right?  You can move below me.  If you move like there.  Okay, I'm moving 25 feet.  Oh, I see him, okay.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12536,I'll take one shot to the south.  Yup.  15 to hit.  15 hits.  6 damage.  Here sits Rump and it dies.  Okay.  I am going to move here.  And I attack twice with my red eye.  Bring it forth.  You critical and you hit.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12561,for 29 plus 19 is for 29 plus 19 is then 20 or 30 plus 20 plus two is 52 damage.  That right?  Yes.  No, 54.  Right.  Wait.  46.  That's a lot of damage.  52.  Yeah.  52.  No.  It's 39.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12591,It's 52.  I just calculated it.  My trust truck is actually the most.  It's 52.  OK.  Yeah, we were at the first time.  You break it in half.  Oh, sorry.  First one cuts off the back end of its thorax.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12606,The second one splits the front of it down into two pieces.  There's no way this cockroach is still  be running around when you're done with it.  Do the other ones get like an intimidation check?  They will make morale checks as necessary.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12626,I move here and I can strike the one on the right.  You wrap yourself around him slithering in and around but the Ankiks scurries over you.  your big snake body is just too slow for these fast insectoids.  I'm gonna use this.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12645,All right, I'll just make a quick recorder staff attack,  blow one in front of me.  Mm-hmm.  Oh.  Critically it for 15.  All right, time for me to make use of my mobile feet.  So since I hit it, I don't have to take an attack of opportunity from it.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12665,I'm going to move 5, 10, 15, 20.  533, 5 right here and I will attack this thing.  Excellent.  There, one of these.  15 will hit for five points of damage.  All right, then with mobile I will back off over here.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12692,I will go over here and look menacing.  As it goes over to look menacing,  I've got one more attack I can fire because I only fried one to kill that one creature.  Mm-hmm.  22 hits home.  Well hit.  Six points of damage.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12704,Easy.  Right.  The oncigs are in maybe a bit of a tight spot.  The remaining ones make morale checks.  They do okay, especially when their friend comes down to play.  And two more dropped from the ceiling above.  Let's see.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12721,How are we going to do this?  This one is right next to Trump, so it's going to just do its thing here and attack you.  Can real quick, just so my theater of mind is working correctly.  How are these?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12735,When these are coming down the ceiling, we look up, do we see a bunch of them crawling  around up there?  No, there's a hole up there that goes to what looks to be another floor about that.  Oh, okay.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12745,And can you, is the floor like this whole thing is like a giant hole or?  But if we can see them at the moment, shouldn't it take them more?  Yeah, because what I'm wondering, if you've got them dropped down and attacked?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12760,Because if you've got like one hole right here, it's got to use like at least 10 feet of movement,  well 15 probably to go through the hole and come down and then once it's down on the ground from 15 feet of movement to like however much harder to go.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12769,Yeah, last time I used 15, 10 feet of their movement to just jump off the ledge where they were positioned at the end of the previous round.  round. The hole is about yay big right above this area.  Oh, okay, okay, okay.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12781,All right, that would have been good to see that, but okay, gotcha.  Of course, this one next to Trump makes a bite with the 15 to hit.  The this one next to the snake bites at the snake with a 15 to hit as well.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12793,That'll hit the snake though. Snake will take 11 points of damage,  and this other one that has just dropped down.  Did Trump knock a hit?  No.  Okay.  Uh...  Ah.  Yep.  And this one will kind of scurry down to this spot and bite the snake as well for 20 to
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12814,hit or 12 damage.  I reduced the damage by 2d6.  Roll it.  7.  7.  So 5 and the 11 from the previous attack.  Are you marking damage?  Yeah, I got it.  Wow.  Excellent.  Player turn.  Okay, I hit once first to the one to my left.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12838,No, let me kill that.  Wait.  You crit it.  Because you have advantage on both attacks if you hit the so I should be hitting the ones.  Because I can't ever have advantage.  You gotta go and slay it.  And I'm over here and I hit the one that was attacking Trump.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12855,Mm-hmm.  19 will hit home. The axe lands for 12.14 points of damage.  I'll start wailing on the one in front of me.  Where's Staff? 5 and 12 to 17 are hits but no kills.  And then I'll finish it off with a kick.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12883,which will finish it off and it dies.  Blah.  Ah.  Then I turn tell and I screw this way.  I am trying to find  my ability that I had  because I want to eel.  Isn't it?  What the fuck?  about Wild Shape 5e. Circle the Moon. Sorry, just a sec. Okay. I'm going to construct the
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12922,one that's flanked with Minsk. Good. You do. Okay. Wrap him. Consider him constricted.  And then I'm going to burn a level two spell slot to heal 2d8 as my bonus action on combat  wildshake.  There you go.  That's a bonus action.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12953,Yep.  You gain nine hit points.  Hmm.  Do you get your wisdom mod to that at all?  Uh, it just, it just says,  expend a spell slots or again,  1d8 hit points per level of the spell slot expended.  So yeah, I don't think so, yeah.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12969,All right.  Okay, so this constricted creature,  I do have advantage against those,  on those shots, right?  On over strength creature?  Yes.  All right, I believe I will be taking a double shot.  21 hits, 18 hits.  Oh wait, I'm just gonna roll another 1d20.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,12987,Oh, right, right.  And then another one day 20.  Okay, so another minute, okay.  Damn it, John, oh geez, sorry.  It's like 22.  Yeah, 22.  Almost dead.  Is that all the players?  I believe so.  Oh, all right.  This guy has grappled unrestrained,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13014,so he can't turn around, I'm gonna say.  There's no real facing in fifth edition,  but I think that's kind of dumb.  So I'm gonna say he's stuck facing you  because you were like holding him in position  while you're restraining him.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13028,This guy will scurry to this spot.  There you get no tech.  A chain of acid like this.  There you get an attack of opportunity as he moves past.  No, he never actually leaves a threatening square of yours.  Well, wait.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13044,He should kind of have to, right?  Isn't this guy occupying four squares?  Can they stand on top of each other,  or when you have to make an out of the radix tricks?  So he can spray and then like end his round
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13054,while finishing moving through this, right?  So he scammers.  But how does he move through the other hand, okay.  Or his allied friend.  Yeah, you move through each other squares all the time.  All right.  They do it too, yeah.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13063,So he scrambles over the guy who's being restricted  by the snake, scrambles over the snake  from on top of it breathes acid on you guys  and then comes down to a better position for combat.  Hmm.  Okay.  of you in this line, make me dexterity saving throws, or suffer, or suffer nine points of damage.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13087,You will both take four points of damage instead, and this guy has had his acid.  This other one is just going to spray his acid at the giant snake. Giant snake please make me a  dex save. Um, what's the second?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13103,My life on snake though. Huh? 13 damage to the snake if you fail your dex save.  How do I, how do I see the hang on? Sorry. Okay. My dex is plus two on the snake on grub. It's
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13118,three. Yeah. Okay. I will, um,  I will wait. Yeah, I will dodge.  I think you have to use the snakes thing.  I can use either one. It's a very specific.  The statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13146,personality, intelligence, wisdom, and charisma scores.  You also retain all of your skill and saving throw  proficiencies.  So if you're proficient in decks, you retain your dexterity  proficiency to the throw.  But the stat, you keys off of the stink stat instead of your stat.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13162,I specifically remember looking into this and reading  like an official thing that said that a big part of Moon Druid  is you can choose which one you want to roll  in terms of your save, whichever is higher.  I need to go find it.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13175,That are written right here in the book.  You know, if we want to play about the rules,  then we should use what the book says right here on page 67.  That's a, that is a, that doesn't have to do with saves though.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13187,Um, in terms of, yeah, it says you also retain all your skill and saving  throw proficiencies in addition to gaining those of the creature.  It doesn't apply to saving throws.  Yes, it doesn't.  Uh, Moondra can choose their saves, but it'll take me a long time to find.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13202,It doesn't matter.  You were going to pass whether you use the snakes role or your role.  I'm just being a pedantic asshole.  It's what I do best is just argue pointlessly.  I see you will damage Devon take by two to six.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13216,Eight thirteen, so you take half of 13,  which is six reduced by 12 to, can you reduce to zero?  Yeah.  And you can reduce any source of damage?  Yep.  Wow.  Maybe you should nerf that too.  Looks kind of powerful, Kalebu.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13234,That I'm actually okay with that one.  It's done.  OK.  Super natural protection.  You have to check into it.  Like, that takes up to level six.  It's not a first level cantrip.  I teched into my entire class.  OK.  I fucking am it.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13248,It's the whole thing.  That's all I have.  And you took it away from it.  Reaching the creature, take damage.  You're that much awesome cantrip.  You want to replace your useless thing with you, Tom?  I'm still deciding.  How many captured are they to choose from?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13266,Six.  Wait, really?  Yeah.  No, five, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,  and he already has two of them.  OK.  And one of them is the other one.  So 13 to choose from.  Ziya's gone.  Everyone's gone.  The pancakes gone.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13284,The players go.  That's what we are.  But the players go.  Right.  I will.  I'm gonna slap the one above me.  Did you say slap?  Yeah, with my Dwarven
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13318,dies crumbled in snakes here bony body  but haven't described snakes all right i try to construct this one now before destiny goes  give me you have advantage so you grapple the crap out of it thank god yeah i just knew this was
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13337,gonna happen 29 is a hit 27 is a hit give me the extra d 20s just in case destiny and you did 14  damage to it and you do 22 damage to it. The oncangs are dead but something tells you
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13357,this isn't the last of them. Are we out of combat? For a short moment only because we're  gonna go to our break right here. I have some there are things happening you hear the sound  of skittering feet when we say skittering feet and when we say for one second do I have
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13376,when I have time to retrieve my arrows, that's what I'm asking.  Only if you want to risk having the enemies get  to drop on you, literally.  OK.  Well, if we feel like things are coming, right?  And it's basically the nice turn.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13390,I want to move here.  And I want to ready on a time.  We're on break.  We can figure that later.  We're not on break yet.  We're still live, boys.  Do we want to go on break?  We're going to break, OK?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13397,We're on break.  All right.  We'll be back in a bit.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13428,you
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13458,you
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13488,you
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13518,you
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13548,you
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13578,you
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13608,you
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13638,you
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13668,you
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13698,you
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13728,you
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13758,you
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13788,Hello everybody and welcome back to Empires Over Katie.  You can hear that the hive you're in is alive.  you through the hole, you can hear the sound of wings beating and kite-ness plates scraping
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13822,over each other. Small little heads peer over the hole down to this flare of carnage.  How many can I estimate in terms of 10s, hundreds, thousands? You are guessing right now  in the realm of tens, but it could very easily be in the realm of 100.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13847,I mean, you have no idea, right?  You can just see like, you know, five or six faces looking down at you and hear about everyone.  Let's get out of here.  Yeah, we should leave.  How much time has passed?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13857,I want to pick up my arrows.  I'm just curious.  You can start walking around and picking up arrows.  No, no, I will like, what does it sound like?  Do they sound like a scaring for far away?  I hear him like right above me or like give me an update. I should be able to hear this
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13871,There is just the one hole directly above that middle section  I'm worried don't worry about it. I'm gonna is powering down from town  You see face there are faces peering down right now. How many faces?  There are five or six faces peering down at you right now. Well sounds like we're gonna get the fuck on out of here then coy
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13890,Yeah  crap  You guys begin to back up and as you do  three of them will squirt one last round of acid in your direction. I think not three. I think  probably just two of them will squirt some acid in your direction. Can I get one dex save for the
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13909,snake and one dex save for Minsk as the creatures squirt. Minsk, they will do ten if you fail, five if  you pass, you fail, and Grub, they will do 11 if you fail, five if you pass, and you pass.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13928,You guys back out and head down to pass the way somewhat.  So we have a big problem.  We promised the dwarves that we would clear this place out, and there's a hive of hundreds  of bugs.  Okay, but you're saying hundreds.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13948,You're a Mr. Always Worst Case scenario, so there might only be like another 10 to 12  how many do we kill here, like 11?  Right, there's also the idea that it seems now the threat of a giant, whatever, the worm,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13965,I guess a worm wouldn't have dug this, it's too small for a worm, it's just these guys.  Yeah, these guys dug it.  Yeah, okay.  So we, here's what I suggest, we rest, come back and finish the job and be more prepared,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,13976,better position. Not above their layer. Yeah, we can do that.  I mean. So, okay. These guys are dumb, so we can just  lure them out to this area and just come one by one, but they  can shoot acid. We should angle it so that we should, well,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14003,look at me, but look at the size of this.  Look at this right here.  This tunnel, if we angle ourselves here,  then they can't spray in a straight line around  or something like that.  Geometry or some shit.  Yes, people that are smart to be helped.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14023,But now let's go anyway, let's go.  I think we should go back all the way to the doors.  Go outside, have them lock the cave again,  and then we rest with the doors.  We went over this, they aren't going to let us do that.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14034,Wait, they should?  Well, they said they would periodically be checking the area, so we'll chill there.  They said they'd only help us if we weren't being chased by a thousand bad things.  Let's go back all the way to the entrance to where the dwarves led us in.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14049,Yeah, I mean, at the very least, I guess we can rest there.  How long did it take us to get here?  Pretty close, right?  was really close.  Was that like an hour or something, right?  I thought.  Yeah, it was like 20 minutes from the main passageway
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14064,and then the main passageway you guys walked through  for maybe an hour or so.  Let's do that.  Okay.  Was there anything obvious around that would let us barricade  a tunnel with?  Just the earthen tunnel itself,  which you could try and collapse down on them.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14081,If we ever feel like taking the nuclear option, do you have some sort of like big sound effect  or big thundery type thing?  Grop.  Yeah.  I do.  I could do some crazy shit.  Like we're talking collapsed the entire on keg nest type of stuff.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14108,Oh, I'm doing that while we're in here.  I can do it.  to risk you right we'd have to be back on the main table or whatever right I'm  saying that's a last ditch nuclear option well that's like the suicide nuclear
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14118,option right I mean we do it and then we run away into the tunnel and then like  as it's collapsing we get out that's I can do it that's like plan C but I'm  just saying that's plenty I could do it just say the safety word okay
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14138,Okay, so I don't know what okay, so you guys you want to rest and you actually want to go back there and start  Yeah, we're resting. We're gonna come back. We're gonna clean them up. That's what we're doing right now, right?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14154,There's no other alternative. Let's go go back to the beginning. Can we walk back to the beginning?  Yeah, you guys can back down the tunnel head back down that main passageway. All right  I'm knocking on the door knock knock knock bang bang bang
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14165,the large stone wheel that they very specifically called they would not be able to hear you on the other side of  Hey, so they might not to your heart's contents  I can't hit it a few times in out of frustration and then I yeah take a seat and I lean my back against it I
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14179,Can't guidance to ask the gods if they can open the stone for us  What do you mean I'm kidding  It's full shit just ignore me  Slowly trickering every bone in my body  You do well of that  I cast a speak with animals to talk to the door
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14208,Your mom replies  Okay, we can take a short rest right here, right if we wanted to yeah, we got food they can show us food  Yeah, you want a short rest? Yeah. Yeah. Yep. That's what we're doing  Taking a short rest.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14219,Cool.  Sweet.  Everyone rolled me a d20.  Oh, baby.  11.  Do your worst, Koibu.  19.  Do your worst.  Right.  Grubba.  You're on watch again, buddy.  Why?  Always your watch.  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?  The tunnels are actually quite bright because you've got minxas axe nearby.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14244,And so you have 60 feet of very bright light.  But your 20-something passive perception  starts to stand your hairs up on end.  And you start looking down that tunnel.  And even though it's dark,  you know that there's something out there staring at you,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14265,watching you from the edge of the light.  Hi.  It's definitely there.  100%.  Quick question, do we get any hit that back  during the rest that we do get to do?  Not until the whole rest is taken.  Where's that?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14290,Is it an animal?  If you don't know what it is, you can't see it.  But you're, you know, the back of your neck  is all goose bumpy and tingly.  Okay, and it didn't respond to my high.  Uh-uh, but there's something there.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14306,You're sure of it.  How you doing?  No response.  OK, I will throw a pebble over at Minsk.  His forehead.  What do you want?  There's some guy out there.  Well, do you mean there's a guy out there?  I was there.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14330,It's fucking crap.  What do you expect?  I can't I.  Hey, on.  Hey, on.  I start the ritual for speak with animals.  OK.  Is this a particularly loud or quiet ritual?  It's just grub lifting his staff up and down.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14350,Usually things that things that grub does normally.  Yeah.  OK.  All right.  you cast speak with animals. Hi. Hi. How you doing? There's a guy out there. He's there.  I know it. I have a hold up my axe a little bit in order to try to see better. It's just
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14384,at the edge of your light.  Cm must be a little farther.  Maybe should walk towards it.  Can you give me any sample of what the cave  we're in right now looks like?  It is carved stone walkways, walls and ceiling.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14401,You're in the dwarven tunnel section.  It's very sturdy, very well made.  Can I stay away standing watch  to make sure that the others get the rest off?  It's still there. We're in the process of it being there.  Yeah. If you want to forfeit your rest,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14418,then you can go ahead and keep watch with grub for the rest of the time.  Why don't we just go get it?  They could be all of them.  It's going to be all of them, whether we're there now or not.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14432,Maybe it's waiting for us to let down our guard.  So if I stand here looking menacing as fuck, the others will get the rest off.  Why want to answer me then?  Why the fuck would it answer you?  Because I can talk to it.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14446,So.  So if I says hello, it's supposed to say hello back  because if it doesn't, that it's rude  and no bug won't be rude.  Obviously.  Thank you, Siz.  Okay, hang on.  I know, I know how to get it to talk.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14468,Here we go.  Hey, hey, bug guy.  Why did the dwarf leave the tavern?  I pick up one of my light stones  and I throw it down in the general direction  of where I grab a thing city.  Because they raised the bar.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14486,Ah!  You chuck your light stone.  It bounces off the ground,  and sure enough, attached to the ceiling  is one of those oncangs.  And as the light stone sort of skips and bounces underneath,  drops from the ceiling, rotates like a cat, lands on the ground, turns end over end, and
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14503,scrambles off into the darkness.  It didn't respond to my joke?  No, it didn't.  That's so rude.  I bet it bugs you a lot.  Yeah, what's this problem?  What are you guys going to do?  I wake up the others.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14528,Hmm, okay. We're awakened and we see a creature at the edge of our vision.  Since now.  I'm scampered.  Oh, he's gone.  I know the end case.  We're watching us.  They know where we are now.  I don't know if it's safe to stay here.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14540,Do you really think these things are intelligent enough to spy on us?  Well, I try to talk to it and it was like didn't answer.  Don't you think that real rude?  Sometimes I try to talk to you and you don't answer.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14553,All this time the doors haven't opened the door.  I may have not opened the door.  Is there anything we can do to open the door from the inside?  Nope.  What if we hit the wall around the door and walk through the wall?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14570,Only one way to find out.  Can is there any crafts being enough for Boo to crawl out?  No.  It's nice and sealed.  Tight dwarven architecture.  architecture. What's the wall around it? Carved stone. Good thing I have stone to
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14590,flesh. If if I scream loud enough is there any chance that any of it will go  through? Yeah definitely. Okay, hold on, give me an intelligence check. Oh, saving  Oh, nevermind.  So, it's regular intelligence check.  Yeah.  Definitely.  If you shout really, really loudly and they'll hear you and open the door, you're guaranteed.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14616,How could they not?  You, your mink's, your voice is so big.  I live out of Belloping Roar.  Open the door.  Everybody wakes up at this.  If you weren't already.  And there's no reply from the dwarves.  Or I go back to sleep.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14638,I roll over and I go back to sleep.  Yeah, I didn't join you back in the sleep.  All right, I go sleep too.  Okay.  I'll stay watch.  It's still your watch.  A little bit later.  You see one of these oncags scamper from the darkness galloping
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14658,but it's not coming for you.  It's coming for the light stone.  And it takes the light stone in its mouth  and gobbles it up,  and then turns and runs into the darkness.  Goodbye.  Why, you know, like my joke.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14672,You just see this like orange glowing thing  scamper into the darkness because the, you know,  it's got the light stone inside of it now  and it's projecting out a little bit.  Okay, goodbye.  Did it respond?  It does not respond.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14693,I feel that sensation of being watched.  You get the impression that there are others out there waiting.  Grub puts on a little show with sock puppets.  They talk to each other and do a little dance.  I think you, uh, I would ask the other players to make perception checks and if they roll
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14719,greater than, I don't know, 13, they wake up because.  Because.  Grub is like doing a sock puppet show while everyone's trying to sleep.  What the fuck are you doing?  I'm doing a show for the bugs.  They're still watching us and you didn't let us know.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14735,Well, they need shows too.  What if they're born?  I  Wait, did you did you guys leave that lights don't out there? We paid good money for that. You know it's in  Don't know where it is 30 of these things. Oh, oh
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14752,Grub forgets to tells you one eats it then runs away and I say goodbye  But he not even respond you believe that  These are the rudest bugs grub ever find and grub find some rude bugs grub grub find lots of bugs and grub time
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14764,This is how many more light stones do we have?  Let me counts. Let's see.  One, two, four, 47, 59, 62, 587, 433, and four.  Four left.  I have one left.  That one was yours.  You were carrying two?  Okay.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14791,Anyway, so this one eats it and then it runs away and then they comes back  So I do show for them and they not even entertain and this is Grub's best sock puppet show  Let's see is this the fourth watch for this is the first watch
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14807,or this is  watch number two two of four  I  Well if they start attacking us wake me up. I go back to sleep  Okay, bye  Oh  Rob continues his sock puppet show  No one can sleep  Imagine being in a room with a bunch of people and
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14833,I was in the upper right then.  Grub's like, come in, in the back.  Sock puppets are arguing.  Everyone's like waking up, you know?  Okay, Grub does, Grub modifies his sock puppet show  to be a silent movie.  And really accentuates the emotions of each puppet.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14850,Okay, I can do it.  It's like a horror movie with like the bugs  and there's like a goblin  and they're running around in circles.  Yeah. Mm-hmm.  Some time later, everyone cycles through their watches  and eventually feel rested enough
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14865,that you can expend hit dice.  And I will give you tokens here  if you need them to expend your hit dice.  Clean me, click.  Oh, now let me click too much.  Yeah, it just has the...  So, be patient, fund.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14893,Oh my god, I got three ones in a row.  Oh!  And a ten.  Eight.  Rob is very frustrated that the bugs didn't respond to his show.  to the show. Yeah. What jerks.  And the and speaking to them.  We made it through the light.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14923,That was a that was a one in 512 chance.  Trump. Good job. I think.  But was rolling three ones in a row.  How do you know that?  Eight times eight times eight.  You did that in your head?  No, you do it on a calculator, right?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14937,Windows key are eight star eight star eight enter like 10 keystrokes  I'm so sorry wish I was as smart as you destiny  Me too  What is eight times eight times eight is 64. What is eight times 64?  What is eight times 60?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14963,I have no idea  480 plus  Eight times four is 32 five right?  Yeah, that's right  Yeah, this is we can do this  Do this in our heads guys  What are we doing right now, are we sleeping we're sleeping you've all woken up you've all woken up
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,14985,And your hit dice you're in the same hallway. You're surrounded by 60 feet of bright light  There's a dwarven door behind you and probably a whole bunch of buggies in front of you. All right  Hey, onward why you think they know respond are they still watching us grub?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15001,uh, yeah  They've been watching us the whole time I did this fucking show for six hours and not a single one clap this single time  That this preposterous we should kill them for this is on there kind of agree actually
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15018,very rude. That's a bit of an exaggeration. Grubbs and  side take over for you two hours. Really? So did I feel  them watching me during my watch? No. Oh, it was just a creepy tunnel.  It's probably just grubbing crazy. Okay. You know how he gets, right?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15041,Well, then let's go finish off the rest of that nest.  Okay. You can head back down the tunnel, get to the fork, take the right, turn round, go up,  go through the corkscrew, climb up into the mountain for a few minutes, and come right back to that layer.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15061,There was no bugs on the way.  As you walked forward, you didn't encounter a single one.  I want to on the way up the mountain. I want to cast ritual speak with animals again.  Okay. You can cast it before you get to the main chamber. Yeah. That spell of yours scrub.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15085,Isn't it for animals? What spell? What's the spell?  Well, when you talk to trees to let you talk to animals.  There ain't no trees here, muck man.  Only animals like bug, grub talk to bug.  Are you sure a bug is an animal, Grub?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15107,Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Hang on.  Wait, maybe not.  Yeah, probably not.  Okay, well, let's just finish exterminating them.  Can you speak to it?  Yes, Grub, yes I can.  Why don't you tell them to enjoy the show?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15137,Or why do you think they not enjoy my sock puppet show?  It's not really their thing.  And they're quite uncultured, so we should slay them all.  Okay, I help you with that.  Okay.  Well, here you are.  I think, uh, okay.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15160,Here what we do.  We set up in this hallway, make big noise,  then they all come in and then one by one.  Pow.  Okay, maybe instead of this narrow tunnel and so this cavern, which is really wide open.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15177,Wide open bad.  Then more bugs.  It means we don't get sprayed by their acid.  Why not?  I don't like getting sprayed by acid.  No, no, no.  Why why it mean that?  Can I hear anything right now?  Can I hear any scampering or anything?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15195,Give me a perception check.  Actually, but.  Um, no, not yet.  I think we should take this as a two phase plan, Grum.  You see, first we fight in this wide open space,  and then maybe when there's a lot of them,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15211,we back up into the tunnel.  So, Corin, you can look into this area where the battle was yesterday.  Do I see a body?  And all the corpses are gone.  Do they remove my arrows before taking the corpses at least?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15223,Uh, they did not.  There might be a couple arrows lying about that happen to, like, miss and fall or hit  something and happen to fall out.  I'm sorry.  What did you say?  What did you say?  I'm just going to make one D- really 1D4 for how many arrows are incidentally lying on
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15237,the ground.  Oh, okay.  It's not only you said miss, which didn't make sense because I didn't miss a single  goddamn shot.  But I will roll a 1D4.  Is that three arrows I find?  Yeah, you can see three arrows out there in that square and that big pit if you want
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15252,want to go out there and get them.  OK, hold on.  Hey, Corinne, if you need more arrows,  I got one for you.  I plot a quiver.  Can we get an idea of how, like, are there bug footprints?  Is there any idea of how many of them
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15266,move through the cavern since then?  No way, because it's so many, right?  Like, if you could see all the footprints  that you leave in your own house,  you wouldn't be able to tell how many people are here,  because there's a 10-100 million footprints in your house.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15279,Same thing.  Like, you're in the creature's lair.  They're everywhere in here, so there's no way you could ever get.  I would actually because I've written Destiny in the bottom of all my shoes.  I engrave it so I can tell they're my footprints only.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15290,I toss the corn.  That's really weird, man.  You give me 10 arrows?  I take a quiver of arrows and I toss them.  It's 20.  20.  OK, I'm adding 20 arrows to my thing.  Regular arrows, not all the arrows though.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15304,Yeah.  I'm only going to use my regular arrows.  I'm going to use Alvin arrows on these weak encounters.  Rob, could you do me a favor?  Okay.  What do you want?  I want to see your puppet show  and the full volume version.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15316,Really?  Yeah.  Oh.  I'm in back here.  Girl, I'm taking inspiration  if you don't already have it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Girl immediately starts a very goes in front of Zai.  Devon, I need you to take your socks off  and give us a puppet show.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15338,I can't take my socks off.  Come on, Devin.  Hey, okay, hold on.  I need something to drink.  I got this.  Wait, why are we having him do a puppet show?  What's going on here?  Cause I want to see what his puppet show is all about.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15358,It's really important.  That's me.  It's half the game.  Someone like you could possibly understand.  Okay, I'm sorry.  All right.  Let me get a better view behind this rock here.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Wait, we have to wait for Zizor.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15380,He has to see it.  Okay.  Are we in the correct positions?  I'm gonna be here.  Okay.  Wait, where are you?  I can't see your puppet show.  I'm sh- I'm showing it to you.  No, I can't see your character.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15400,What?  Why not?  Where are you?  I'm right here.  How can he not see me?  I mean, you're not within my line of sight.  Oh, you're there. Okay.  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  Okay.  So why'd you find a time?  There was.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15418,Hey, wait, Corinne, do you have an attack, right, Ed?  Sure.  I'm running my attack.  I'm ready to travel in.  already my longbow also.  There was a little govo and he met some friends.  And one of the friends was a Monkman,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15434,and here's the Monkman.  And one of the friends was a big, big old barbarist.  He represent two puppets.  He's two puppets tall.  And one of them is real quiet guy in the corner.  We're very angry puppet.  Okay, so, and then all four of them go on an amazing adventure.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15452,and then they get to the big cavern.  Ooh, and in the big cave, there's a bunch of really mean bugs.  And so gobble, compensate, hello, bug.  And then the bug doesn't go, because bug isn't bug,  just like mean guy over here.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15472,Mean guy know talking.  And he's just like, I'm like, oh, yeah, I'm going to go.  I'm like, I'm like, oh, yeah, yeah.  Mean guy over here.  Mean guy, no talk and bug guy,  no bug guy, no talk too.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15484,They should be friends, you think?  Yeah. So anyway, so then they talk  and the bugs say what?  And then bug, no bug, not say nothing.  So then we say, okay, it's there,  and it's there, they're all night.  And so, Drub Goblin does puppet show,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15500,but bug doesn't even know, doesn't care,  doesn't care nothing.  And so, and then Drub keep party up all sleep  And, uh, Corinne person, he's like,  girl, let me sleep.  And go, like, no, no, we have to see the puppet show.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15514,It's very important.  And then Corinne, like, I want to sleep.  And then go, like, but the puppet show is really good.  And then I'm like, I don't want to see.  What?  Was I meant to see that?  Did my character see that?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15527,If you saw something, your character  probably saw something.  OK, should my ready to tack off?  Would you see?  Where'd you see it?  I can ping you.  I saw a red health bar here.  It moved.  Anyway, so then he's like, yeah,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15544,but the profit show is keeping me asleep,  but you gotta keep me asleep.  I wanna sleep, girl.  And I'm like, why are you so mean?  Well, because I was mad as a kid  and they took away all my abilities
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15555,to be in our church and stuff.  And so now I'm really angry and I keep really quiet.  And he's like, well, you shouldn't do that.  You should be really happy  because that's what life is all about.  And well, I don't know about that.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15563,I think life is about killing enemies  and all that sort of thing.  They're like, well, there's other reasons to be happy, you know.  Anyway, this goes on for some times.  And then, grubs doesn't really get nowhere,  so grubs gives up.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15573,Then grubs wakes up and grubs comes to friends.  And they go, it's just time to test this little.  So, Minsk, I think that red HP bar you saw  is indicative of seeing something sort of move  for just a moment, but not actually having a clear enough shot
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15589,to see a creature, like a whole thing,  but you saw maybe a leg for a moment.  But was it an okay?  Yeah, I, you can tell that there's something there moving something alive, but you didn't  get like something.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15603,I saw something.  Your shots.  Okay.  I can do I have to keep going?  I'm running out of here, bro.  You're gonna stop talking until so that was wonderful.  That was so good.  But that's only one percent of the story.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15617,Oh, look, let me save the rest for later.  I think right now you will let grub.  No.  I think right now the mean bunks are coming.  Okay, yeah, they are real mean, real rude.  That was gonna get to that in part 27.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15631,Well, I'd hoped the bugs would come see the show,  but I'm it's, could you throw some hamster food that way?  Yes, I throw some hamster food.  Where do you throw it?  Just like here.  There.  Yeah, okay.  You toss some hamster food.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15649,You sure you don't just want to toss a boo out there?  I'm sure that's food, you know.  Maybe that would be more appetizing to them.  No.  Okay.  You can hear the critters.  Now that Grub has stopped talking, you can hear the insects around you.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15671,I look out there.  No, they're not on the ceiling, but they're there somewhere.  And then all at once they come for you.  They come on the walls, they come on the ceiling, they come on the floor, they come out of cracks
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15691,that you probably didn't even see.  I think I saw a movie about this one.  So this guy will scamper in like that.  This one will scamper in over here, you'll go here, you'll go there.  This guy will be crawling along the wall.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15710,This guy will be crawling along that wall.  This one's here, here, here.  That guy's on the ceiling.  That guy's on the ceiling.  I think that's all of them.  And they start to swarm you guys.  Like an infestation all over.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15726,Now we get back from this ceiling.  Now we get back from this ceiling.  No, no, they're coming in through this gap  and through this back gap.  Are you ready to tax go off now?  You're ready to tax go off.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15739,but they are here.  24 on the first one I see.  You think that's the one below Trump?  Yep.  Okay, I guess I'll shoot at this dude.  26.  12 damage.  Is this dude this one here?  Yeah, I'm sorry, I thought I did.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15762,Yeah, that's fine.  Sorry.  Perfect.  And Zai hits that one as well.  Okay. The bugs are here. They have a,  used the initial round to crawl in and I think now we should roll initiative as they swarm you all.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15777,Do we run back to the tunnel?  Hmm. Yes.  Well, let's get some initiative rolls.  I'll handle this one guys.  All right, great.  Corrin goes first party.  We all have to roll.  No, all right, and I think you have to double time run me. Yeah
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15802,Yeah, we'll say  What are you doing?  From my do I'm finding that I hit this thing and then go to the tunnel  So I'll cover your escape corn, okay  I'll wait for you to hit it. I'll wait with moving
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15820,I'm just going to strike it with my core staff and again.  And I was missed.  20 is an easy hit.  You smash one of its legs for seven points of damage.  I finally run straight for it and do a kick.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15839,Add it.  You break one of its mandibles off of its face.  I'm revaved out off of it and then start running down the tunnel.  Oh, parking it yet.  I could get 50 feet away, but I'll stay for you.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15855,Yeah, they're perfect.  That's what I want to do.  I'm going to throw my javelin.  Another one.  I'm going to have three left.  I throw one javelin.  60.  60 more hit.  I'm trying to just get you some more tunnel segments to work with.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15896,I don't think my dark vision works correctly.  I think you might just be clipped into the wall.  Oh, okay.  It's not very heroic for you to stand behind me.  Everybody get out.  Grub will take the front.  The promised if I stay here, they can spit on me.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15918,I ain't not here.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, the crab has long to take the five.  Where's Corin?  I'm going to retreat back into the tunnel.  You can't see my cute movement.  Can you, Qui Bo?  No, not until you release it.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15930,Okay, did you see that?  Yeah, I see that.  Okay, so that's 50 feet of movement and then I have 10 more feet, so I'm moving here and then I'm done.  Alright, Grub is going to move here.  Grub is going to transform.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15947,Tell me about transforming into a snake in this corridor. I think I can do it.  So the giant snake is a huge creature and you would be squeezed in this corridor which  prevents very, which incurs very specific penalties.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15962,But we discussed that a, oh no, but you're a snake, right?  So snakes can wriggle out nice and long, right?  Yeah.  So before you transform, I think what we want to do is we want to have the enemies basically
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15973,work for us right now.  me and probably trumped from laying them in mailing.  I think if you transform right now, they're just going to be spraying you down from range.  Okay, so you want me to go behind you and support with spells?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,15989,Probably even your cantorplay infinite flame if we're getting them one at a time,  this is going to be an easy fight.  All right, I'm going to do that.  All right, so grub, you were here.  Okay, so you moved back there.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,16003,Everyone is in those positions.  I can't I also have some bad ass shit I can do if I'm if I'm spell-sporting yeah, okay?  monsters turn  The first one is going to run in start to climb up on the side of the wall and climb like over you guys
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,16021,Through this ten foot tall passageway to behind you  Back absolutely  from everyone  Uh, through everyone who has a melee weapon in hand.  Okay, sure.  I'll try to whack it.  What else about me?  Sorry.  Whoo!  Critical miss.  Uh, Minksk.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,16048,Uh, Grub, can you hit it first?  Yeah.  What does it matter?  It's attack of opportunity.  It's got to be Minks that hits it first because otherwise Minks is a actually grub will get  an attack of opportunity because it never leaves his square, nor both Minks actually.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,16061,Wait, wait, wait.  What?  Right here.  It's still adjacent to both of you.  It never left your threatening reach.  That's how attacks have opportunity to work, right guys?  But it entered it.  It doesn't matter.  You don't have Sentinel.  Or it's still there.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,16075,You still have like the alarm master, whatever, yeah.  It's still in.  Right, right, right.  So it's when it walks away from your range  that it provokes the OA.  So this one calls behind you guys  without provoking the attack from Trump.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,16089,This next man on the wheel.  Scamper over to here on the wall.  This one's Scamper's over here onto the wall.  This one will scamper up and over behind you guys.  This one will provoke an attack from Minks, though.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,16110,With the one that's far on the right,  should have provoked at this point, right?  This one right here, no, he's still a kitty corner to Minks.  Their corners are touching.  Okay.  11 to that guy. This one down here minus 11.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,16129,We done.  We done.  Give this guy it's hard to position him, but he's on the ceiling.  I'm going to give him like a heart plus to show that he's on the ceiling while  these other guys like on walls.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,16142,And this one will just come here.  is this winnable?  I think we have to pull out all the stops here.  I mean, I can just piece this out.  Rob, it's time for Plan C. Plan C.  Are you sure?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,16161,No.  As you guys are completely surrounded by these bugs,  we will take our break and when we come back,  we'll see the battle on the other side.  Alright, we're back in a second.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,16201,you

KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,16506,you
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,16566,Well, everybody and welcome back to Handpars of Arcadia.  It is the party's turn.  Don't they look excited?  All right, some state storm.  Scatter, yeah.  As I go attack the back,  I try to clear path with my quarter staff.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,16581,Okay, you've pushed into the space.  You're surrounded by bugs.  Make me some attack rolls.  Yep, got one on the back.  Okay.  That's what I'm looking for.  Nine will hit the one in the back, slaying it.  Great.  These two are on the ceiling and or on the wall.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,16604,One's on the ceiling, one's on the southern wall.  Can we get this late to start down first?  Would you say Trump?  And they both consider it adjacent right now, tell me?  Yeah.  Okay.  I will attack the one on the wall with a quarterstaff.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,16620,20 wall and we'll hit it for six points of damage.  Roll out a concave also.  There's a stunning strike on that.  Point of six, it gets a con save, four.  All right, it's done.  It is done, Mark.  Yeah, and then I jump up, mil fast,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,16641,and kick the bug on the top.  I kick it right in the gut, and I try to stun it.  Ooh.  It will...  Consave pass. So the one on the top is the one that is not stunned, right?  Yeah.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,16657,Okay, the one on the wall that is stunned.  Alright, and after that initial volley I go another...  I go around the bend.  Are you sure we want to do that?  Yeah, we need to know where, but...  So that the spray doesn't hit us all.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,16674,No, no, no, no.  We'll get an attack of opportunity on you.  16 to hit.  No, I attack both of them, so they see you right yep. I we're holding here. Yeah, we're holding here with the seat storm  That's why we just discussed
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,16688,They're just gonna spray us all then they won't be able to spray in the sleep storm. No  Of course they will  They can't see  They're in our general direction anyways go for it wait are we flare have have we casted sleep storm yet?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,16704,I have not we haven't but there are a lot of bugs. I don't think there's time to talk you had a whole break to chat actions  Cassie some slave storms  I  Koibu  Can can I?  Can I transform into a creature a giant ant?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,16722,Yeah, I think you've probably seen giant ants before uh-huh  Because I think well they can climb on walls correct. Yeah  Yeah. So, so, so the giant spiders. I don't know which one you want. The giant  answer stronger because it's a it's HP is 80 10 plus 16. So, um, but it's AC sucks.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,16741,But okay, um, I want to, I want to um, cast lead storm first. Okay. So, so I am  going to cast lead storm and the area I'm going to cast it is pretty important.  Um, but I want the AoE effect to reach out here.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,16764,So we're going to center it on the end of this arrow just about.  Uh, sure.  I can't find an entry for giant ants.  Is that a standard monster?  Giant ant soldier is a 5e creature.  As far as I know.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,16779,Um, it seems like he's, uh, a form acid.  Yeah.  That's the guy.  I'll link it to Pope Undisport.  There's a high angle here.  This guy's a opponent.  Yeah.  I'll link it to fibon this part  of
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,16811,present is the  only  Love you too,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,16854,Cult of madness, total of madness.  Is this even an official creature?  I think so.  Total beast.  I don't have an entry or a stat block for this.  So I want to pull something that I do have on hand.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,16871,So there's a lot of books, a lot of somewhat source material.  That's not in any of my sources.  So what can we do instead of a giant ant?  Well, there's a couple of options.  I can become a swarm of poisonous snakes and then get-
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,16886,You can't become a swarm.  Okay. Okay.  Perfect.  Oh, what book is T.O.B.?  Tome of Beasts?  Tome of Beasts page 23.  Well, I don't have Tome of Beasts.  I don't know if it's a...  I'm gonna skip it.  If I don't have the books and I haven't read through them yet,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,16904,I don't want to start pulling shit from whatever.  It's like life or death for this fight is the problem.  If I we're gonna stick to the books that I have that I've read through that publish this spider  By the two times weaker than this thing. It's a week has sleepstorm yet. Nope
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,16924,chicken  Can't what can you get at least give me an idea then of something that can climb a wall of Sierra to this cool  Because I I'm like I'm fishing bro. Okay. I will dig through this  you can do beasts that have climb, right?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,16942,Yeah.  We've got scene and you want something that's CR2.  Not a giant shark.  Not a scorpion.  We can't climb wolves, they're too high.  Snakes, octopus, hyena, lizard.  It's only a quarter.  Okay, go.  There's some dinosaurs like monster manual dinosaurs like an allosaurus.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,16974,They don't have climb though.  Oh, okay.  Right?  That's what you want is you want the wall climbing.  Yeah, I think so.  I think giant spiders probably your best.  Actually, hold on.  Are these guys?  These guys are CR2.  What?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,16990,If they're, I don't get eggs.  If they're beasts, then you can turn yourself into an on-cake.  I'm just like a, then I'm like a shitty,  there's like 80 of those and like I'm one of them.  Huh.  Well, I mean, if it,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17004,CR two, CR two, right?  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah.  Uh.  Double check, make sure they're beasts.  They are large,  velocity,  not beasts, unfortunately.  Mm-mm.  That was a good one to turn to,  and to do the AoE attack.  Yeah, it's true.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17020,Yeah.  Um, OK, I mean, I got the only thing I can do is giant amp,  but that's twice as weak.  So if that's the that's the play, that's the play.  But I mean, it has 20 HP.  I'm basically dead.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17034,What about spider then?  I mean, I just said that or giant spider.  Yeah, it's it's a what about snake then?  Look where we are.  Can't transform.  OK, so spider it is has to be.  So I will I would like a sweet storm in this area.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17052,I don't know what Trump's doing.  Like the like the runaway is not good.  OK, so you sleep storm first 40 feet wide.  You wanted to put it here?  Yeah, ish.  Is that right guys?  I think that's right.  One more in our direction.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17070,Yeah, like this one.  Does it stop chlorine from doing anything?  Yeah, you tell me you tell me where you want I'm sorry. I'm just reading the spell. Yeah  The voice of raises your surgeries heavily secured a Swiss first spells area first turns it starts there
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17089,Yeah, yeah, where it is is fine now  and and  Then I will transform into a giant spider that walks on walls  Or I  I don't really have like a large it's even if I become a large creature at this point. I'm still gonna get squeezed
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17109,Yeah, because it's so tight  There's creatures above you and on the walls and allies nearby. It's gonna be a tight squeeze quick question  What about that open area to the right? Can he be a snake there if he were to run over there?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17121,He could probably open up into a snake  So  Once I cast a spell I have all my movement right yep, but disengages an action. Yep  but Nimble Escape is not for goblins so I can actually I can actually disengage
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17138,so you can because this is a bonus action and run over but then I have used my  bonus action so I cannot transform right the problem is we if I yeah yeah all  right okay we're just gonna declare that action is done that no we're not because
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17153,I know it's really important where we move I'm not gonna move there I'm gonna  move here okay because I want to yeah and then that's it that's all I can do  Okay, next player did he provoke attacks of opportunity or no
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17165,No, I didn't use him. Oh, yeah, that's why I disengaged  Okay, I'm going to be moving so this is 30 feet of what?  Wait, well, I guess you didn't start your turn in the sleep storm  But you did sort of start your turn in the sleep storm. You didn't move until after it hit
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17181,So I think it is difficult to rain for you. Okay, and you will need to make a  Dexterity saving throw or full-fro  Dexterity saving throw 24 I'm good. Yeah. Can you move? Can you pause on your movement so I can
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17198,Advantage on the one above me  You're not gonna have flanking on the one above you because you'd have to be on the other side of the creature  Right you have to be able to draw a line totally through it
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17208,We're only looking at the 2d model, but it's actually a 3d picture  So the one above you need to be above the ceiling to get the advantage on  Okay, can I I can move here? Yes. Hello. Yes. Are we good? I get one or two attacks opportunity
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17223,Who's stunned the one of the south to Sun? So I get one attack of opportunity me, right?  Yep, hit me  24 you take 15 points of damage  I wanted to I  Reduce it by the 2d6. Oh reduce me
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17239,That takes your reaction to do right. Yes  Five.  So that means you don't get any reactions, no opportunity attacks, no ready to actions  during the next round.  Sounds good.  Okay.  This guy to the south, he's stunned, right?  Yeah.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17254,Okay.  Big boy attacks are coming out.  I will take a shot at him.  Okay.  So 28 easy hit.  28 to hit.  Okay.  I'm going to roll this damage here.  That's 12.  I'm going to throw a 1d8 trip attack.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17272,I guess it's loading right now. Don't know why hold on. Okay for damage with the trip attack and it has to make a strength save or fall prone  It falls off the wall and slides to the ground stunned and upside down now
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17287,Exposing its tender underbelly. Okay. Can I take another shot?  yeah  Crit  You crit it and kill it and it dies. Okay, I would like to use my action surge  There's another creature here at full HP  Wounded but sure wound it. Oh, sorry. I can't there's a lot of people on the kick
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17311,Trip attack it does it fall down and take damage?  What are the rules are they stuck by their feet or what happens?  You have never encountered a well we are countering it right now, so I would like to add a 1d8 to that for a trip attack
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17322,Oh, okay. Roll me some damage. Seven. And the regular damages.  Um, I clicked it. Sorry. Eight. So 15 damage all day.  Okay. And it makes a strength saving throw. Seven. Bails.  It will tumble off the ceiling and land on its back.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17340,It's feet are 10 feet in the air, but its back was only like, you know, six feet in the air, so it doesn't take falling damage.  So it doesn't take any damage? No, but it does fall down.  get advantage on this way is laying on its back yes and the 30 this is added
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17357,again corn yeah that's a good tree all right you will kill it  mink okay the one above me I am going to attack twice with inspiration all  right inspiration only works on the first attack roll but go ahead and take it
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17377,16. Good job on the inspiration. You  flap it twice. I forgot to say I  rage. Oh no. You can rage. It's  fine. Okay. I understand that. It's  a normal thing to do.  Torment.  I have 12 plus lamp plus four.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17402,16 for 25 damage. No. 25 then.  25 damage excellent and what do you do at the end of your shirt anything yeah  but I don't have control in my character maybe I have to refresh oh it might be
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17419,awkwardly positioned I should move back right now the loading make sure to spread  out man I moved as far back as I can there's I don't how much  there we are  but are you gonna be fucked if I'm in further than that this guy takes an
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17451,opportunity to choose you back away doing 11 points of damage to you have  because you're actually only the slashing is halved.  So that's gonna be three and four, still seven points of damage.  If we're back too far out, there's no point to the sleep zone.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17463,You shouldn't back up, Mins.  You're in the perfect spot.  Should I just stay here?  Let's go.  Get back in there.  OK, I'll just stay here.  I was in my really dumb area.  I was trying to see how to move.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17476,I'll just stay.  OK, just gonna get super surrounded.  That's fine.  It is the OnkGeg's turn.  I'm gonna just delete these corpses down here.  Great for impactable.  One on the wall, crawls over here, staying nice and high.  See, these guys need to make deck saves or fall prone.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17498,Is that what it says?  Yeah.  Rollo cover.  Rollo roll.  Four, five.  Oh, sticks of these guys.  One, two, three, four, five, six.  Wow.  Those are my bad rolls. Holy shit  And Devin your safety is 14 so only one of these guys gets out of here without a problem
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17526,the other ones fall prone have to use half their movement to stand up and  Then this is  What do you call it difficult terrain so this guy is down to?  45. Okay, 45. 35. And then he will scamper over here. He's gonna be above you. This guy is,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17553,he's used 15 plus this other stuff to get over here. No problem. He's gonna use his 15, climbs onto  the wall. This one will climb up and over. Right here.  So we can go to 20, 50, 20, and 50, 50, 50, 50. You can just barely get to there.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17582,It's there. And you little guy, if you stick to the walls,  no, you're not gonna be able to get any of these places. You're gonna have to stop  right here. Okay, so most of these people have used all of their movement. Most of these creatures
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17601,have used all of their movement to get out of the sleet storm and surround you, except for this  last guy who just moved in, who will just take a regular bite at Minsk with a 24 to hit. He will
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17612,do an amazing almost max damage on everything you will take half of the 15  which is 7 plus the full 5 from acid so you'll take 12 points of damage as this  oncig grabs you these other guys actually this guy can do it too but he
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17627,doesn't want to spit acid on you right now this awkward and so he's not going to  and that is going to be the monsters turn PC's  Can you give me an honest no bullshit assessment if I can use the spell call whitening here?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17642,Absolutely not okay, you need to cast it like a hundred feet above you in your indoors. Yeah, okay  What if he lays horizontally and that's I'm just gonna say  Okay, I'm moving back right here provoking one attack of opportunity hit me
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17656,Yeah.  Alright, we will take a new deck of opportunity on you.  Yes.  12 to hit is a miss.  I think Devin moves into the opens for intern since I think they're starting fighting  the one above.  Yeah.  Is this one almost dead right here, Kweibo?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17677,Just everything is layered on top.  I can't see that one.  Yeah.  Ed was should be.  Yeah, yeah.  That one looks maybe almost dead.  Okay.  I'm going to take one shot at it.  my elven longbow 29 to hit I will drop it it is dead it is how did you know I
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17693,don't know how I know these things see this guy right here on the wall mm-hmm  I'm gonna take a shot as well with my bow 21 to hit gonna add a 1d8 to it to  knock it prone it needs to make a saving throw and then it's also going to take
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17709,some damage fails fails pro wait I click the damage okay so it's taking 11  damage this guy right here is prone so he should have advantage on it if he  hits it right mix well yes so you have advantage on that one mix and then I'm
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17726,gonna back up another 15 feet and I'm done okay all right here I am going to  cast I'm popping my second one too quite a bit but okay I do get second  wins back on short rests yep I do okay all right we're doing some real shit I
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17745,am going to cast conjure animals oh yes and I want eight CR one four creatures  fuck so this is the problem with conjure animals is when you do eight CR one  creatures combat rounds take days then don't put things in the game that are
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17765,gonna insta kill us on an on an encounter because I have no choice to do  this if I don't even out the actual economy we're dead so that it's we are  killing this so easily this is like one of the easier encounters we've done I
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17777,don't understand it's not okay we're we're thinking very carefully about it  because if we like if we we so far been playing pretty well but there's and we  I also don't know if there's more behind them too.  Okay.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17790,Yeah.  It is actually a pretty dangerous encounter.  Yeah, it is.  It's right.  Conjure animals.  Imagine if we had to fight all of them.  Like without killing the first class.  If you're going to swarm us, I'm going to swarm.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17805,I think that's the world.  Sure.  It's just it's going to take a while to play out the game.  And that's fine.  That's fine.  There.  four D8.  And we'll generate macros for you.  Is that a frog?  Yep, this is a giant frog.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17833,And a cave?  Eight of them.  Hi, the token is now almost set up.  Let's just you were going for.  On 4, yeah, cool.  1, 2, he chooses the type I choose the  number, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17860,Right.  Are you gonna summon them on me?  I can't choose what some of them he can  They in free space around you  We want to let me get to truth where they were he I don't  Can I come here? What's the last time you chose where they were area back here is too
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17881,Sleepy so you can't see in it and this area is has no free spaces to conjure the creatures  I'm only open area and not to not to fuck myself  But actually the sleaze storm would cancel because I believe country animals is a cost
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17896,So and the storm dies so we can summon them behind yeah, but  Yeah  Perfect and then I am going to move back and then I will transform into a giant snake  All right, you back up and become a giant snake.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17920,Roll me giant snake HP.  AD 10, AD 12.  All right, plus eight.  Okay, all right.  Okay, and I can't attack because I cast spell this turn.  So that's the end for me.  54 HP.  Do you want to go before me?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17944,For me. I will move up here real fast.  Do you intend to hit it and then come back? Feel free to do what you want.  Hit it and quit it Trump.  Okay, I'll just take my turn now. I'm gonna attack it twice with the core staff and then punch it with unarmed strike.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17963,Hit, hit.  Punch, punch. Is that thing at full health there?  Yes, it was.  I'll throw a stun check strike at it.  Alrighty.  Uh, no, it should be con check, right? It's the same thing.  Uh, it should roll 14 if it's con check.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,17981,15 if it's a strength check.  Uh, 14 for the con check, just barely fill.  It's a...  No, alright.  It is stunned.  An arm strike at an advantage, that's 18 or six.  Oh, right.  And then I...  Easy.  I go back to where I was.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18001,Okay.  Okay.  I attack.  You are swarmed.  Yep.  I attack with my Darwin Grey tech twice on the one below.  There should be something that gives you advantage.  If you fight next to the Frogs.  I think there's no reason for me to attack the Stun one, right?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18017,That will lose this turn anyway.  No, no, no.  He's only knocked prone.  Attack.  Attack the one on your, right in front of your character is facing because the Frogs  because the frogs flank it.  Get advantage.  You should attack this because you only have flanking on it.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18030,While it's knocked over.  Yeah, I can kill it as well.  Yeah.  All right.  I will.  I attacked the south one.  South one gets struck.  Critically struck.  You've been rolling a lot of 20s today, I mean.  I think it's that 42 points of damage.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18045,Yeah, you slaughter it.  What do you think?  Oh, right.  Plus the rage.  OK.  and the frogs roll their own initiative,  and they come in after the onk eggs, whose turn it is now.  This one is stunned until the end of your turn.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18067,This one's dead, dead, dead.  So we have one, two, three, four.  This guy is going to spew acid in a line, sort of like that,  clipping five of these guys, I think.  I'm just gonna do one grub.  Will you give me one deck save for your frogs?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18091,I know it gets a little swingy,  but I don't want to keep track of so many things.  Yeah, I totally respect that.  Yeah.  No problem.  They will all take half damage from this.  It is 12 points of damage
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18109,the evil, which will take six. You go down.  Oh, I thought they would all die.  Down. Down. Down.  Down.  Down. This guy on the wall is going to do his own acid spray through  um, he'll scramble so he can spray like these for.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18136,We'll get the top left one. Give me another dex save grub. This is 12 points of damage again.  If it fails, it passes another six to these guys. Well done. Sixty here, that one will die.  This one will take six. This one will take six. The onk eggs hiss in anger and terror
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18159,is frogs around them.  Or maybe hunger?  Hunger might be better.  Yeah.  Palzodes.  Those are some old memes.  And this guy will spray these three.  Give me one more deck save.  And does 11 damage on a fail.  Sorry.  That's all right.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18185,Wow.  That's a crazy roll.  This one dies. This one lives. This one lives. Those are the  other ones that get hit. You have also used your weapon. And  this guy in here is going to wait on the one that dies. I
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18205,could actually save it with because I have my reaction bike.  I know you just use your reaction. Didn't you just use  Nope, I can't remember before that. Okay. Yeah, you want to try and prevent some damage to one of these froggies. Yeah, I want to say one frog
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18223,It takes the taste nine less damage, okay  It survives then  This  Oops not that one  This on cake here is going to uh skedaddle  Nowhere, I think the snake is gonna get it no matter where it goes. So it'll just bite the snake
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18240,11 to hit no is not a hit believe it something miss that that only time you've  been missed yes in the whole game literally the entire campaign  I feel like I'm missing two on Kegs one two three four five six seven eight nine
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18263,ten where my other three do you guys already kill three we've killed quite a  Yeah, he just killed one. I think I killed one last turn or two. I don't remember other  Yeah, but there's three that aren't on the map. Maybe they're still they were in the storm
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18276,No, I don't know. I guess they're gone. It's not a problem back to oh, it's the frog's turn they go at the very end  2.13 all right Devin take all your frogs turns what do you mean? It's your your thing
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18290,Okay, all right. I'll play Dungeons and Dragons against myself good. We can do this I  I will watch on quite but let's go six seconds rounds  Aside for the frogs koi boo  All right, the frogs are all going to make bike attacks. We can get one two three
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18307,These three are gonna attack the lower one so we go one two three  One of them will have advantage on it. We'll say that's the first one  Wait every fucking bike grapples a creature. That's what that says. That's what it says. Holy shit
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18323,So only one frog will actually do damage  It'll do seven and  We'll grapple this on keg  This frog up here. We'll try and bite the one on the wall. We'll miss these guys in the back can't actually do anything this guy
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18340,I'll say advantage this advantage cancel. He will creep that guy for nine and it becomes the players turn  Okay, what's grappled  Are there was two hits a mess?  There's a hundred thousand of these onk eggs everywhere. There's frogs everywhere. You can't even tell what's happening
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18357,It's a mesh of wet frog and dry insect and your own bloods burning and we got frog on frog action  It should be a chaotic mess for I have advantage on the one time inside right to my left
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18372,Yes, okay, I'm gonna advantage on it  Hit and hit.  10, actually 12 and 18 will slay it.  It's a dead one.  What's going on with this creature up here?  Why does that have a symbol?  Is it on the roof?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18390,He's stunned.  Oh, can I take two shots at him?  Mm-hmm.  Crit.  19.  19.  and regular hit which will kill it.  Easy kill.  I will conscript the one right next to me on the left.  All right. Go for it.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18414,I did. 12 is no good.  That's my turn.  Yep.  I'm going here for 15.  Remove there for 20.  35 feet.  I'm going to strike at this thing.  This is a living bug  that you, who square you're moving through presently.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18436,Okay.  Go through that.  Yeah, you need to be halfling to do that.  Got it.  All right, so I walk here instead.  35 feet of movement.  I'm going to attack in twice the course now.  So it was a miss glancing blow
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18449,against its front pincer.  25, though we'll kick it in the face  for a whopping 12 points of damage.  Okay, I'm very much wait, I'm there punch 17 17 hits  Explosioning damage  And then I'll back up on this me. I should have done that over here
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18472,Can you um, can you delete corpses crap, or do they need to be here? I?  Love the confusion again  Never mind helps us to understand how messy and like you might not know who's stunned and who's grappled and who's used what weapon?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18484,That's all right. My big archer brain can process all of this in six second round  So we're good. I'll just shoot at anything I see moving I cast as a reason  eight more CR one eight  There are concentrations fellas your first ones will vanish yes, yeah
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18499,And the DM will fly out to your house and slap you in the face  Wait, what if he cast what if he cast it as a cast it as a cantrip is a bonus action  For at least the bonus concentration only if you've got flanking going on okay
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18514,Flanking just means you need to be standing at least ten feet in the vicinity of the creature right you get flanking if you can  flank with the wall  Right right as long as there's something on the other side of them instead of nothing and you're within ten feet of them
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18525,God you get the bonus action flank sounds good. Okay, right  Okay, so all the players go yes, who's turn is it please God all right? It is the oncage turn  This one will crawl down off the wall.  Actually he's first gonna try and recharge his breath weapon.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18543,It fails, the other one fails to recharge.  So he'll climb off the wall and bite you with the advantage,  Corin.  16.  Oh my god, his teeth are huge.  What are those?  40, 16 armor class.  Yep, so he hits you.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18557,You will take six plus one is seven damage.  And the one behind you turns around to bite you as well.  Well, this is the snake because it couldn't hit the snake, but he'll bite the crap out of you for five and three is
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18571,gonna be eight  So what was the total damage I take?  seven and eight so 15  And  Then this guy on the wall will come over here provoking  two acts of attack some opportunity from frogs the first one will bite and miss the second one will bite and miss
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18593,Wait, and from the wall? No, because he's against the wall. Okay. We were joking about that flanking roll  And without advantage you will attack Corin with a critical hit anyway. How am I getting a juke so much kwebo?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18611,16  Is divided by two so that is going to be 18 plus seven is  15 points of damage to you. You keep you keep calling makes corn  I'm sorry, I apologize.  It becomes the giant frogs churns.  This guy will slip in.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18628,This guy will slip in.  We have five giant attacks against this one.  We'll start with the least advantageous one.  One, two, three, four, five.  Okay.  Two kits, including a crit for three.  And what is that?  Thirteen.  Yeah, actually this one would have hit
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18648,because it would have had advanced attacks.  Actually this one would have hit because it would have had advantage as well.  So 14 and 9 damage is 23 to the onc egg and it goes back to the party's turn.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18664,Mink's.  You're almost dead.  I have to go on to the left.  Once.  Do it.  Hit.  I'm at hand damage.  You.  Kill.  Okay, I  Get advantage on the one above me too, right? Nope just the one behind you  Yeah, okay, I will actually attack the one to my right then
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18695,Whirl around the dwarven great axe swinging in your hand you cleave into the creature for 13 damage exactly  It's remaining hit points. It dies on the spot. We have one left somebody else take it out  Can I move through the snake guy or since he's huge. Yeah, he's your ally. Hey 25 guy on the wall
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18712,I'm shooting him two times  One two twice 12 12 is 24  I'm gonna add a 1d8 to 1 six more damage trip attack to knock him down. I guess  And it was the DC on that I have no idea
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18732,Yeah.  That's a good one.  Is it a key is off of strength off of decks?  Must be off of decks.  We're going to do here your spell save DC is 16.  Just as a strength saving throw.  They have to pass.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18747,Yeah, but it's keyed off of one of your stats.  And I think you get to pick strength or dexterity as a fighter  to be your core staff.  That'd be awesome.  I mean, dexterity is one I would choose, right?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18761,Let me double check that.  I might be giving you unfair advantages here.  It's a 17, that would be freaking huge.  Yeah, yeah, the DC save is eight plus your proficiency bonus  plus either your strength or dex modifier, your choice.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18775,It's eight plus eight.  So it's six.  Keep plus your three is 11 plus five is six.  Yeah.  Oh, 16, okay.  Yeah, that's pretty awesome.  Cool.  Yeah, it's a really high save.  Yeah, he's knocked on the ground.  Yep, he is prone.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18793,Monkman.  All right, time to sweep it up.  I'm going to hit that prone one twice  of my quarter stuff.  Excellent, those will both hit  for 18 points of damage almost, but not quite killing.  I try to finish it with a kick to the head.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18810,14.  14, now it's AC is 15,  but when it's flipped over onto its back,  you can see that its underside is actually way softer  and a 14 will hit its underside.  Beautiful, so the underside.  Stick it right in there and I burst through.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18824,Yost enough to rip open the thorax of the creature  and put your foot in its goo.  Did we find the lights done in there?  No, that one's still missing.  There's at least one more oncage out there.  Okay, oncage's turn.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18842,None of them move.  They just sort of twitch at you a little bit.  Is it our turn?  Yeah, combat's still going.  No, the oncaves are dead.  I'm rolling 92 to pick up arrows.  Yes.  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18858,Oh my God.  I will pick 7.  These are hard to break.  Didn't we say that ones were the ones that you picked up?  I'm pretty sure we said twos.  Twos makes more sense, but I kind of thought we said ones once upon a time.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18869,It's fine.  Twos makes more sense.  I'd rather have it be that way.  Okay, I agree with all of us.  Take a roll.  It makes rolling guy should be good for you.  So you guys can clear out the bodies.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18882,The frogs will frog about for a little bit.  What happens if we kiss one of the frogs?  Probably turns into a prince.  Oh, we'll have to get married.  Let's not do that.  No, let's not do that.  A CR 10 prince follows you for the rest of the game.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18894,I want to prince it.  A nymph, I want a nymph.  Do I see or hear anything?  Deep in this cave?  I can send the frogs in.  Yeah, you certainly hear things.  You can hear deeper within the cave are still the sounds.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18910,Fucks.  Okay, do we go back and rest again, round three?  I'm like 12 HP here.  I'm like, oh, how many hit dice do you have left to spend?  I only use, I use three in region one, so I have three left.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18925,Cause I crit on one and now they might throw them the second.  Okay.  I mean, I'm burning a lot of spells.  It was two level three spells.  So I still hear things in this room.  You don't see anything in the room,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18940,but you can hear them probably from that shaft above you.  Can we hear them in the room where my three arrows?  Can I see them?  Yeah, you can see them.  There's one, two, three.  Can I send the frogs to get the arrows?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18957,Yes.  They follow basic commands.  Yeah.  Any verbal commands you issue to them, no action required.  If you don't issue any commands them.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You can issue commands as a snake.  You can't really speak as a snake, but like if they're not understanding your tongue anyway
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,18992,It's sort of like magical commanding at them. So I think they will understand your  What is the Harry Potter call snake talk Slytherin or oh?  Castle time  Wow, how did you know that it's like fucking red all Harry Potter books nerd
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19008,Actually, I didn't know it originally, but then what I did was I asked the gods for help when I cast guidance on myself  Actually increase my history knowledge there  All right, my arrows I want my three arrows back their normal arrows, but I still want them I tell the frogs the ether
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19030,No, they I want them to bring them to  Fogg pops out there and is immediately the subject of an acid attack from one of the  be on kegs above.  Oh, never mind.  Doing nine damage?  Can we use dex save for your frog?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19044,I'd be back save.  He's got any piece of hill survive for my frog.  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  Bring me that air back.  Bring it back.  All right.  Your frog will get one arrow and hit me all my back with it.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19058,Yes.  Okay.  I'm added it to my head.  He'll hop back out and this time two on kegs will acid down on him.  down on him.  Oops, wrong guy size.  Doing 14 and 11, so no matter what you roll on your saves, it'll still die.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19079,Nice.  Send the next frog.  All right, we're leaving back to sleep.  Time to go sleep.  Time to go sleep.  I said the next frog.  Wait, you have all these frogs?  You have all these frogs to absorb the attack.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19088,Yeah, just send them all and then bring.  Okay.  I'm going to add the remaining two arrows back, but I think it expands most of your frogs.  This is how much my our friendship means to me. Thank you. Okay, let's go. I gave all my frogs going back to the entrance
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19101,We're going to sleep corn walks alone. I'm leaving  Party heads back to the entrance way  And I think as you guys bed down to sleep  We will call our session for the day when we come back next week
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19113,There is the rest of the cave to be explored the oncage to be wiped out  Still got to check to see if there's anything else here as well  And then the ruins themselves to be explored it's gonna be a busy week next week
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19127,I thought we had one hour left. There's no so confused. No in America  We just randomly decide that it's an hour ahead or behind for no reason  That's confusing no, it's just confusing those different days is it like the moon or some shit
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19143,It's the moon or some shit. Yeah, I thought so wait for a move the hours ahead and behind  It's all like no, it's because it normalizes when your day is so it's not I think it's actually totally bullshit
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19155,I don't think it does yeah, I think so too the whole world decided to switch to daylight savings time for bullshit reasons  Well, but it what governments got together and equally decided to do this for no good reason
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19166,But legitimately I'm pretty sure I think it was to save like land like oil and lanterns or whatever because if you do farming and shit  You don't wake up by a clock anyway you wake up when the sun comes up
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19174,You go to sleep when the sun goes down, but like I'm pretty sure they're like no good reason  have stores be open later, more hours of daylight to do to go shopping during the winter, is it?  Yeah, exactly.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19185,Otherwise, if someone went down by the time everyone gets out of work,  no, they would have just gone home, but now you have an extra hour of daylight in the winter.  Something like that.  Hold on, hold on.  Let me, I'm trying to remember this.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19194,Devin, can you cast guidance, please real quick?  Yeah, OK.  I guess I'm rolling one day four.  OK, I got it too.  I'm looking up Wikipedia now, I think, too, sign up for that.  Okay, I'm bringing this to the normal screen.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19214,All right, roll us out, bring us out, to play us out.  Evan, you're first.  Go.  Are we doing shoutouts?  What, if you'd like to, you don't have to.  You can say whatever you want.  Hi, I'm Devin Nash at twitch.tv slash Devin Nash and YouTube.com slash Devin Nash.

KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19331,you
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19361,Oh my god.  Holy shit.  Hello.  My fucking children.  I remember reading, everybody, the original thing that I heard was daylight savings time
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19400,exists because farmers needed to change the clocks in order to better do their crops or  whatever.  But then I remember learning that that was bullshit and that farmers just rise and fall  with the sun, no matter what it doesn't matter what a clock says, so they have to work when
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19412,the daylight is out.  And then I think I read that daylight savings time only exists to moderate when people are awake and go to sleep.  Because if you make them go to sleep at different hours than they, um...
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19423,...then they use less electricity.  So I think daylight savings time only exists to save a little bit of electricity.  Is my understanding of it.  Ahhh.  Okay, time to relax.  With some legal legends.  There is no reason to have it today.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19452,True.  Darius.  Darius  What is wed war squad play what role?  Oh  OH  Oh  it's very small small percentage, but like when you're talking about like the the national grid it amounts to like a decent amount of savings  amount of savings. I could be wrong. I'd have to go and check it out. Play with Wolf's
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19481,God. What is Wolf's God play? What role?  Oh my God. What a day. Jesus.  I'm thinking about doing a divinity run.  I have a friend that plays divinity thinking about doing another one.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19511,I don't know.  I want to play more.  I know I need to roll out of a campaign with Mr. Mooten.  I need to make Mr. Mooten roll a non, not to say it offensively, but a non-retarded character  that is can think and talk and isn't like fucking Lenny.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19524,Wait, let me show you Baldur's Gate 3.  I'll do Baldur's Gate 3.  I'll do that.  I just need, but it's not out for like,  who knows how many more months.  But just look.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19554,Yeah, I've looked at it.  It looks cool.  Play the original Volers game.  Fuck no.  Completely different.  Come on, you're going to play up over 7 damage.  Yeah, I just need to hook up my PlayStation and shit.  Ummm... well, swimmingly.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19585,Okay, so I wanted to throw... so I have to throw back and bring a movie or whatever.  Jesus Christ!  Wow, we nine.  months you ever feel like the NPC and somebody else is alive.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19617,Disco Elysium.  Oh great, he's got a video.  Every year, some countries move their clocks forward in the spring, only to move them back  in the autumn.  To the vast majority of the world who doesn't participate in this odd clock fiddling, it
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19632,seems a baffling thing to do.  So what's the reason behind it?  The original idea, proposed by George Hudson, was to give people more sunlight in the summer.  Of course, it's important to note that changing a clock doesn't actually make more sunlight,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19643,that's not how physics works.  But by moving the clocks forward an hour, compared to all other human activity, the  sun will seem to both rise and set later.  The time when the clocks are moved forward is called daylight saving time and the rest
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19654,of the year is called standard time.  This switch effectively gives people more time to enjoy the sunshine and nice summer  weather after work.  Hudson in particular wanted more sunlight so he could spend more time adding to his  insect collection.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19667,When winter is coming, the clocks move back, presumably because people don't want to  go outside anymore.  But winter doesn't have this effect on everyone.  If you live in a tropical place like Hawaii, you really don't have to worry about seasons
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19677,because they pretty much don't happen.  Every day, all year is sunny and beautiful, so Christmas is just as good of a day to hit  the beach as any other.  And so, Hawaii is one of two states in the Union that ignored daylight saving time.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19688,But the further you travel from the equator in either direction, the more the seasons  assert themselves and you get colder and darker winters, making summertime much more valuable  to the locals.  So it's no surprise that the further a country is from the equator, the more likely it uses
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19701,daylight saving time.  Hudson proposed his idea in Wellington in 1895, but it wasn't well received and it took  until 1916 for Germany to be the first country to put it into practice.  Though, the Uber-industrious Germans were less concerned with catching butterflies on a fine
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19714,summer evening than they were with saving coal to feed the war machine.  The Germans thought daylight saving time would conserve energy.  The reasoning goes that it encourages people to stay out later in the summer and thus use  less artificial lighting. This sounds logical, and it may have worked in the more regimented
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19728,society of 100 years ago, but does it still work in the modern world?  That turns out to be a surprisingly difficult question to answer.  All right, one sec guys.  I gotta try my heater in the fucking room.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19767,It's fucking cold in here.  And sir.  For example, take mankind's greatest invention, air conditioning, the magic box of cool that  that makes otherwise uninhabitable sections of the world
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19797,quite tolerable places to live.  But pumping heat out of your house isn't cheap,  and turning on one air conditioner  is the same as running dozens of tungsten light bulbs.  If people get more sunshine,  but they don't use it to go outside,
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19808,then daylight saving time  might actually cost electricity, not save it.  This is particularly true in a place like Phoenix,  where the average summer high is 107 degrees  and the record is 122.  If you suggest to an Arizona to change their clocks
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19820,in the summer to get more sunshine,  they laugh in your face.  Sun and higher electricity bills are not what they want, which is why Arizona is the second  state that never changes their clocks.  Another problem with trying to study daylight saving time is rapid changes in technology
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19832,and electrical use.  As technology gets better and better and better, more electricity is dedicated to things that  aren't light bulbs, and the lore of a hot, sweaty, mosquito-filled day outside is less  appealing than technological entertainment and climate-controlled comfort inside.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19845,Also, the horrifically energy inefficient tungsten light bulbs that have remained unchanged  for a century are giving way to CFLs and LEDs, greatly reducing the amount of energy required  to light a room.  So even assuming that daylight saving time is effective, it's probably less effective
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19859,with every passing year.  The bottom line is while some studies say daylight saving time costs more electricity  and others say it's saved electricity, the one thing they agree on is the effect size.  Not 20% or 10% but 1% or less, which in the United States works out to be about $4 per
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19874,household.  $4 saved or spent on electricity over an entire year is not really a huge deal either  So the question now becomes is the hassle of switching clocks twice a year worth it?  The most obvious trouble comes from sleep deprivation and already too common affliction in the Western world that daylight saving time makes measurably worse.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19890,With time tracking software, we can actually see that people are less productive the week after the clock changes. This comes with huge associated costs.  To make things worse, most countries take away that hour of sleep on a Monday morning. Sleep deprivation can changes.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19903,Okay, is 480 million dollars in lost productivity for a week? Is that actually that much?  How many Americans work?  If I okay, so have a hundred and fifty seven million Americans are working this is like a few dollars of productivity
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19926,per person over a week. Like is that really that?  Or is this like, is this maybe more localized on some sectors of the economy or something?  I don't know.  This comes with huge associated costs.  To make things worse, most countries take away that hour of sleep on a Monday morning.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19944,Sleep deprivation can lead to heart attacks and suicides, and the daylight saving time Monday has a higher than normal spike in both.  Other troubles come from scheduling meetings across time zones.  Wait, how old? Oh.  This is a 2011 video. I'm gonna say how old is this video?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19957,Thruicides and the daylight saving time Monday has a higher than normal spike in cool  This has a really dark joke for a CGP grave video. What the fuck holy shit  Other troubles come from scheduling meetings across time zones
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19970,Let's say you're trying to plan a three-way conference between New York London and Sydney  Not an easy thing to do under the best of circumstances  But made extra difficult when they don't agree on when daylight saving time should start and end in the spring
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19981,Sydney is 11 hours ahead of London and New York is five hours behind  But then New York is the first to enter daylight saving time and moves its clock  Hello, hello two weeks later. Okay, holy shit  You're coming to my speaker some one more week Sydney being on the opposite side of the world leaves daylight saving time and moves its clock
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,19997,Week's New York is something okay, you're some great all right. I always sound great  Why didn't you play on your alt account Steven listen?  I'm I'm platform. Maybe you wanted to be around with me again  You wanted to get to diamond with me is that what happened? What okay? You d-ranked so I d-ranked too
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,20014,That's just how it goes. Oh, okay. That's what I thought. Okay. That's really sweet of you actually  Okay, we're gonna go to Ben Tar again actually no you said ye cast right that's your meme  Do you already been casted in?

KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,20070,seconds equals one minute 100 minute equals one hour.  It would be sick as fuck.  He's eight years supporters have been on this floor today.  Can you say to you?  Just like true.  We said that to say.  I'm not going to stop with this.
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,20094,I'm dealing with a global crisis.  You know, with dealing with it, you're asking me these questions.  Who's good for now?  Right now I'm trying to do my best to make sure that we don't have time.  Armando, are you in trouble?

KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,20150,Okay  I feel like there are like seven different names to refer to like fucking GMT  Fucking time zone. I feel like there's like I feel like there's like 70. There's like I think UTC GMT  European Central Time is off by GMT by one, right?
KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,20169,Fuck European time zones.  You guys should be forced.  you guys should be forced  okay you guys should be forced to use american time zones every single european  should  why is it relevant even in here dude

KdYKb9b1pNc,20200318,20259,Because I definitely don't pass, especially my e-mail ass hair.  It was a struggle growing up because people, my brother was a gang banger growing up.  And in high school, I'd be like, oh yeah, my brother is this guy.
