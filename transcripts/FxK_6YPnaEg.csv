FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,0,For the record, I have no ill will against standards or his political beliefs. The intention was humorous. This photo is 100% authentic. Our country is far too polarized. What is the sincerest reason to brush a prospectiveology back up if it's just gonna neither help you
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,32,It looks like Annie. Annie? Is that true, Pine Nutter? Yeah. I don't know. Play whatever I want. Annie's like brain dead easy, so you could do... Yeah, but Dan was like, okay, so Danny, when you start League, you need to play a character that you relate to. Uh-huh. Does Annie have
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,76,a kitty cat? Does she have a kitty cat? No, she has the Tibbers. Tibbers! She's a little girl, man. Oh, PogChamp. You had me a little girl, my man. All right. A little girl. Let's do it. That sounds perfect. So, the easy champs are probably... You would like Annie. Annie?
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,96,Is that true, Pine Nutter? Yeah. I don't know. Play whatever I want. Annie's like brain dead easy, so you could do... Yeah, but Dan was like, okay, so Danny, when you start League, you need to play a character that you relate to. Uh-huh. Does Annie have a kitty cat? Does
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,113,she have a kitty cat? No, she has the Tibbers. Tibbers! She's a little girl, man. Oh, PogChamp. You had me a little girl, my man. Wait, what? Hold on. I got to mute one second. Destiny, what's your meme of the last decade?
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,164,Destiny? Alright, sorry. My meme of the last decade? I don't know. God damn it, Mr. Wynn is fucking sleeping. Fuck me. Steven? Stop. Hi, Steven. Hi.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,293,How am I going on scuff tonight? I don't think so. Alright, we're gonna run around in MemeCraft for a bit and listen to some stuff. Alright, let's go. First is this guy. Spoiler alert for 1917. If you haven't seen it though, you don't deserve a spoiler alert. Fuck you.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,346,What's up? What? What? Not that one. Not that one? I don't know if that's it. I think I set it up on either the table or the counter somewhere. Wait, are you live? Yeah. Chat, have you heard the Billie Eilish song? I haven't heard it yet, I'm gonna hear it.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,366,Wow. Not yet. It's shit. Link? Okay, bye. Be careful. Bye, Neil. Bye, Neil. We're listening to stuff. Huh? Where's my stuff? No, I said we're listening to stuff. Be careful. I love you. You can see the body and you can see where the heat is. And I feel like sometimes on stage, the heat is in the wrong place.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,397,The heat's here. And the heat needs to be here. It needs to be in your body, in your gut. You need to know where you are, who you are, what you need to do. And the heat drops in the body to the point where you feel them centered.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,410,And the problem with people coming in for short periods of time is the heat comes up here like this. I'm acting, I'm acting, this is my bit, this is my bit, this is my bit. And you have to calm down.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,418,So I remember Benedict, it's very easy to misinterpret a speech like, he has a speech, he says, I've heard it all before. I'm not gonna wait until fog, I'm not gonna wait until dark. I'm not gonna call my men back, only to send them out again tomorrow.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,433,And that came out to me as rhetoric in the first instance. I've heard it all before. That sort of thing. And I said, no, no, no, it's not rhetoric. It's the truth. I've heard it all before. OK, fine. So you just want, and I could just have to pull the energy down from here to here.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,451,And that's what I was doing all the time with those guys. I was just rooting them, rooting them. Like Andrew Scott, you've been there for months. You fucking hate this place. You know, you're sick. You've had the flu. This has happened just before. This is about to happen.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,465,You know, you drag two men back. When you say I dragged two of them back here two days ago, you know, I shouldn't have bothered. You fucking carried those fucking corpses on your back, down into this hole, and they were already dead. Tell them that in that one line.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,483,So it's about lived experience. And just have to compress, compress. Take what you remember. Take everything you've done and push it down into this very tight space in which you're trying to communicate in a very limited time everything you've lived through.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,498,And that's what we're doing with the boys. But the boys had much longer to express those things. So they could come out in little moments here and there. But with the others, they needed to sit on this big well of emotion and experience, lived experience.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,512,So I had to do a lot of description and walk them around the set, show them No Man's Land and describe things that they would have lived through, talk to them about it, rehearse a little bit, and then say nothing on the day as much as I could,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,525,except occasionally step in and say less, less, or more. And you know, you said that to a point, is that result-oriented? And I don't think it is in a weird way. Sometimes you just need to say 25% less or quicker.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,538,In a way, it's the clearest thing. You don't want to be standing on set going, talking about their deeper motivations when you're in the middle of a frigging scene and you've got two hours to go and the light's going.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,548,They should know that already. And you do want to be talking very, very simple terms. And so for me, that was the big job of this movie. But normally, shooting is a bit more experimental. You can try stuff out and you don't have to make the decisions.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,564,But for this one, I had to make the decisions as we were doing it. So it was much more like theatre in that regard. Because I had to say, that, that's it. Now hold that, but later in the scene you need to do that, that you did two takes ago.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,576,So there was a bit of this. Because I couldn't do that lovely thing that you have. And I couldn't do what Bong did, which is to splice up. I did it once, though. I did do it once, where I put two takes together with a split screen.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,591,But yeah, it was unlike any other movie in that respect. Last question for all of you. Although I wish I could spend many days with you. Because there's so much to hear and share. But the last question for us.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,604,What did you learn? Don't worry about it. You'll have to step up. I finished them off, I think. That's where all the good stuff comes out. The actual information. What did you learn on this movie that if you now were to talk to another director,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,624,you'd give this piece of advice? This I learned on this movie. About directing, that I would say if I'm talking to another director, a new director, here's a piece of advice. Or, Sam, what piece of advice might you give?
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,638,Well, I learned a huge amount on this movie. Because there was a bunch of stuff I'd never done before. So I learned what it feels like to direct your own work. Which these guys know. And I didn't know that. And it's fucking vulnerable.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,651,You can't turn around and blame the writer. Because it's your fault. And on the day, if someone says this line's not working, that means you have to rewrite it. And that I learned a lot about what it is to be a writer in a movie.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,665,And how vulnerable it makes you. I learned a lot about that there is no end to the language of the camera. That was to me the big revelation. How quickly we get set into this master shot, two shot,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,683,over the shoulder, over the shoulder, close up, bing bang bong, fancy shot, every three... Whatever it is, the patterns that you find, there are endless, endless, limitless ways to shoot a scene. The camera is its own language. And if you push yourself and make rules for yourself,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,702,which you can't break, which I did on this one, it forces you to find new ways to express things with a camera. And that for me was a huge revelation. When I think you do become very, I at least speak for myself, set in one's ways.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,717,So that for me was the big learning experience. I think for me, what I've learned on every film is to enjoy the danger of whatever it is I'm doing this time around. Or how nervous I might be about a project, if anyone's going to see it, if it's even going to be good.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,740,Because I think with every film I've done, I've always felt like if it feels like, not to be stupid, but if it feels like a bad idea or a dangerous idea or something that I won't ever come back from,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,757,then it's probably worth doing it. There's a great interview with David Bowie about creativity. And they're like, what's creativity for you? And he says, well, it's like when you're walking out in the ocean. You're walking out and you're walking out, and you just start losing your footing.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,775,You just barely touch the bottom, and the water's up to here. You start getting worried about where the bottom of the ocean is and if you can stand up again. He says, when I feel like that, creatively, then I know I'm doing good work.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,787,And I always try to remind myself to feel like that, to enjoy feeling like that. And if I finish a scene, I feel like I covered it too easily. If it feels like it came too easily, then I get very worried.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,801,And I try and make it a bit more chaotic. I try and put obstacles in the way or shake it up and try and find ways of making it more interesting. And yeah, I guess just not giving in to just being easy.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,824,Great metaphor, by the way, the water metaphor that you just said. For you? I'm not really sure how much do I have to do with this movie. Why do my chests... Alright, we're done with this. Why can't I just make chests that nobody... Can I lock chests?
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,843,Why do all of my chests get fucked up? I meticulously organize every chest and then I come online and half of them turn into this. What the fuck are you guys doing? So irritating. What is this? Oh, he saw this one.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,863,Blue them up and deleted items again? Dennis Prager, you blueys leftist made it impossible to say the N-word? What? Private anti-Semitic and anti... No, no, no, I wasn't because I don't think there is a hatred of Jews and blacks in the United States.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,880,I was talking about private anti-Semitic and anti-black language used by Presidents Truman and Nixon. Yes, yes, that's correct. Wait, call her Steve? Wait. My man's literally calling... It's not like... I mean, they're making a joke about... Okay, we'll go do that one later. That's up later, okay?
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,912,Somebody linked me something I thought we were going to listen to. It's about an hour long. It has to do with political hobbyism. Oh, RTB, I wanted to know my enchants. I almost have perfect enchants, so my helmet is missing Aqua Affinity.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,922,I don't know how to get that book, but I need that book. My chest has Mending, Unbreaking, Through Protection IV. I think I can put Thorns II on this? My legs are Mending, Unbreaking, Through Protection IV. These are perfect. And then the boots are Protection IV, Depth Striding III, Feather Falling IV, Unbreaking, Through Mending.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,939,These are perfect. So the legs and the boots are perfect. Oh, Thorns III, yeah. The sword is perfect. I just need to put this Looting III book on it. I just don't have the experience yet. And then... My pickaxe, Efficiency V, Unbreaking III. This is perfect.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,961,My axe is almost perfect. I should have Efficiency V, not IV. And then my shovel is almost perfect. I should have Efficiency V, not IV. But otherwise, I think everything is almost 100% perfect. Are those not Diamond Tools Armor? No, there's a new ore called Netherite, which is an upgrade of those.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,991,You need a Soak Touch. Fuck Soak Touch. I don't give a fuck about that shit. What is this Vimeo thing everyone keeps linking? The Batman camera test. Is this a pair of vanilla? Yeah, it's an alpha, but you have vanilla.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1008,Or a snapshot or whatever. I'm not sure. Pie. Wait, why did like 15 people link this fucking video? What do I care? Matt Reeves. Is this another Batman coming out? How many? Jesus Christ. Does this mic seem low compared to the video? I was just whispering.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1080,Wait, is my mic audio low? Really? Supposedly, this one is focusing on him as a detective. I turned it up to 100, I don't know if that matters. Supposedly this one is focusing on him as a detective. Okay, I turned it up to 100.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1104,I don't know if that matters at all. Okay. 53 minutes. All right, let's go. From NPR, this is Hidden Brain. I'm Shankar Vedantam. When Eitan Hirsch was growing up, newspapers were a central part of the family's daily routine.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1163,If you were a member of the household, you kept up with the news. My parents raised me and my siblings in a politically engaged environment. At least I thought so. You know, we always were. We knew what was going on in the news.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1175,The newspaper was delivered to our home. After Eitan went off to college, his father kept reading, listening to the radio, staying up to speed. And then a few years ago, Eitan learned that his dad had developed a new habit.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1189,He would lie on his bed at night and watch cable news. Out front next, breaking news, Trump's tantrum, a jaw-dropping... Eitan, now a political scientist, found this puzzling. I've never really personally gotten into cable news. It's never been something I've enjoyed.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1206,I asked him why he was doing it, and he said, you know, it's our duty to be informed. And I said to him, but you already are informed. You've already read the newspaper. You've already listened to all the radio.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1216,What possibly more could you be getting from this? I think in the end it was pretty clear that he just likes politics. A lot of people like politics. And to decompress that night, you know, more than the Food Network, the Kardashians, whatever else is on TV,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1231,he likes watching cable news. Millions of Americans are like Eitan's dad. They eagerly follow television personalities and the ups and downs of the latest scandal in Washington. Nearly a month after the House passed two lame... It's been a week since the Razzle TV star Kim Kardashian West visited the president.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1251,CNN's Don Lemon starts now. They know who testified last week on Capitol Hill. Tense moments in the room between Democrats and Republicans. If this is not impeachable conduct within the White House, what is? And what the rumor mills are saying about who's in and who's out at the White House.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1268,Security adviser Michael Flynn has resigned after less than a month on the show. Ben is officially out at the White House. John Bolton is out. He wasn't in the FBI. Gentlemen, I have to jump in here. I love this debate here.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1280,But we have to go to a short break. After that short break, we'll continue our discussion on still more Washington scandals. If you ask them why they follow the news so closely, they will tell you what Eitan's father told him.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1295,It's an act of civic virtue to stay informed. Eitan Hirsch is skeptical, and he has the data to prove it. He argues provocatively that what his dad is doing isn't really about politics or policy or elections. It's really just about his dad. What feels right to him?
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1320,It seems to me that the way that people are doing politics is much more similar to a hobby than to what I think of as politics, which is acquiring power. Today we look at a strange twist of modern politics in the United States.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1337,We live in a 24-7 cycle of political news that saturates every corner of our culture. It seems like this has led to increased engagement in politics. But Eitan Hirsch says that engagement with politics, for many of us, has actually become more shallow.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1355,As a result, he says, our democracy, from the workings of city government to the battle for the presidency, is increasingly distant from the actual needs of citizens. The Paradox of Our Passion for Politics, this week on Hidden Brain.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1396,Will we see more Dr. K content in the future? Maybe. Eitan Hirsch is a political scientist at Tufts University. He studies voting, elections, and how we participate in politics. In his book, Politics is for Power, Eitan makes the case that millions of Americans
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1414,are engaging in politics in ways that are emotionally satisfying, but ultimately self-defeating. They're there to serve their own emotional and intellectual needs. They're not trying to move anyone. They're not trying to empower anything. They're really just trying to learn and engage in a pretty frivolous way.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1436,So I would imagine that a lot of people listening to you would disagree with your assessment of them. I think a lot of people would say, I derive no entertainment from the shenanigans of the Republicans or the intransigence of the Democrats.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1450,In fact, I feel exhausted and dispirited by the state of our politics all the time. I think that's right. Some people probably would agree that, yeah, you know, being on Twitter all the time or debating about some silly news story is entertainment.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1465,But the feelings that they bring to politics are much deeper. They care and they feel hurt that politics isn't going the way they want it. And they feel joy when politics does go the way they want it. The thing is that what they're actually doing is not participating themselves in any active way.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1483,They're really just following the news. They're following the ups and downs of a presidential primary cycle or the Mueller report or the impeachment hearings. And so they themselves are not participating. You introduce a word that I hadn't actually heard in the context of politics.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1504,You said that people are really pursuing a hobby. They're in it for the feels, the thrill of debate, scoring points. And you call these people hobbyists. What do you mean by the term? Yeah, so, you know, I was kind of reading through some of the sociology literature on hobbies.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1524,And what are hobbies? They're things that are people doing either to learning facts. They learn facts about history. They learn facts about birds, whatever they want. Or they're engaging in collecting materials. Or they're engaged in kind of crafts.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1541,And it seemed to me that the way that people are doing politics is much more similar to a hobby than to what I think of a politics, which is acquiring power. So they will learn a lot of facts and talk about those facts.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1555,They will participate in a kind of craft. Like they'll go online and share memes, have a discussion. Very similar to how sports fans, you know, listen to sports radio. They'll talk about the gossip of, you know, what this quarterback or that quarterback is doing.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1570,That's sort of the end of it. In politics, I think that's exactly what people are doing, too. If we define political participation as a form of engagement where you are trying to move public policy or electoral politics in a direction you care about.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1586,You know, you have your one vote and you're convincing another person to vote the way you want or to advocate the way you want. That really doesn't describe the behavior of what most people are doing when they're doing politics.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1598,It looks much more like what they're doing is similar to a sports fanatic engaged in sports or a foodie watching food shows, reading restaurant reviews. It seems much more in that category of life than in the category of power acquisition.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1616,So when I think about a hobby or I think about being a sports fan, I think about people who derive, you know, great satisfaction or great frustration from what's happening. They engage in it passionately, but ultimately they'd have to acknowledge that their involvement has little consequence.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1633,That's right. If they wanted to actually participate in politics seriously, they would go about this all differently. Instead of hating the other side, instead of hating a random person who says they're a Republican or says they're a Democrat, they would say,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1647,Hmm, is this a neighbor that I can convince to move in my direction? And when we talk to organizers who are out every day in the trenches trying to convince other people to come along with them, they don't hate the other side.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1663,It's like totally the wrong frame of reference for them. They're thinking about how do I move a person? There might be a person on the other side who says they're Republican and I'm a Democrat or says they're a Democrat and I'm a Republican.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1675,And my first reaction is, oh, they believe all these things I think are despicable. But my second reaction, if I really care about moving them, is what do they care about that I care about that I can leverage to move them in my direction?
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1688,And in sports fandom and in the kind of shallow way that people engaged in partisan fandom, that second step is never made. There's never a goal to convince a Yankee fan to come to the Red Sox. It doesn't matter.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1701,And if you're online or, you know, only talking about politics to people who are exactly like you, there's no point of thinking of a person on the other political party as someone you need to convince of anything. You don't. You don't need to convince them of anything because you're not doing anything.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1720,And if you're a Red Sox fan, of course, you are deriving satisfaction precisely from the camaraderie you have with like-minded people as opposed to reaching out to people who might actually be outside the echo chamber. That's right. I love being a Red Sox fan.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1733,And, you know, as I say in the book, I live right near Fenway Park. I've gone to Fenway Park and taken my children there and the whole, you know, the whole park at Fenway will chant, Yankees suck, Yankees suck, over and over again.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1747,They've done it for decades now. And it's all kind of a joke because the stakes are low. We don't really hate those people who are the Yankees fans or the Yankees players. It's a game and it's fun to be part of it for a lot of people.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1759,So what explains the fact that in politics people don't think of it as being fun? I mean, if you're a Democrat and you think… Like in high school, people took those sports ball games like pretty fucking seriously. But I don't know, after that I didn't give a fuck.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1771,Terrible. Or you're a Republican and you think Democrats are terrible. You don't think of it as a game. You think of it as being deadly serious. Is that political hobbyism too? What's political hobbyism is not whether you think it's deadly serious or not.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1784,It's whether the emotion is the end in itself or a means to an end. So in shortcut politics, in hobbyism, emotion is the goal. It makes you feel connected to something without doing anything yourself. It makes me feel I am part of this emotional high or I am part of this sad point, this low point.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1806,Even though I'm not doing anything. I'm just following it. But the emotion is the connection. And of course we have a whole media apparatus and social media apparatus to make us feel those emotions. But in real politics, anger, righteous anger and emotion are something you leverage into action.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1824,If there's no second step there, you might feel like you're feeling political and partisan thoughts, but you're not channeling them effectively into anything else. So I want to examine your larger evidence for these claims. And I want to start with a revealing story you tell about two elections in your home state of Massachusetts.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1843,The first was in 2008 and it featured Barack Obama running for president. And the second, 14 months later, featured a special election for a Senate seat that had big implications for the balance of power in the Senate. Tell me what happened in those two races.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1857,So in 2008 in Massachusetts, Massachusetts is a blue state. There was never going to be a question of who was going to win the election between Barack Obama and John McCain. Nevertheless, a lot of people were active and a lot of people voted.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1872,We project that Senator Obama will carry the state of Massachusetts. Very high turnout in Massachusetts, like in the rest of the country, for this presidential election. That in Massachusetts wasn't a close call. A few months later, the Democrats have control of the House.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1890,They have control of the Senate with 60 seats, which was important for the filibuster. And they have control of the White House. But now it's not so exciting and there's a Senate race that comes, a special Senate race,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1902,to replace the seat that Ted Kennedy held. He passed away. And the seat was between Scott Brown, a Republican, and Martha Coakley, a Democrat. Now here, Massachusetts had a chance to really leverage its excitement for voting for something that really mattered.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1919,Now Massachusetts really mattered because this turned out to be a close election and the Democrats' control of 60 seats in the Senate was on the line. What happened? Democrats hold a 3-to-1 advantage over Republicans in the state. But the GOP candidate, Scott Brown, has waged an energetic campaign
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1939,and he's polling well against the Democrat Attorney General Martha Coakley. From the not-close, from the landslide Massachusetts election for Barack Obama to the really important Senate election, turnout dropped precipitously and it especially dropped in highly Democratic areas. So when there was really a moment for Democrats in Massachusetts to say,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1961,you know what, even though politics right now maybe is down for the Democrats, maybe the candidate for our Senate seat is not as exciting as Barack Obama, we're going to come through because we really care about holding power,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1974,instead they sat at home. I thank the people of Massachusetts for electing me as your next United States Senator. Scott Brown won that election. And so if you're only willing to vote when there's a celebrity or someone who really is drawing you in to the excitement,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,1994,then you're going to not do so well in the downtimes when the chips are down for your party, the candidates aren't as exciting, but the policy matters just as much. There's another story you tell about Massachusetts, and this one took place in 2019.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2009,Democrats asked students to go up to New Hampshire to canvas, or even just to canvas locally, and on another occasion, the students were asked if they wanted to take a road trip to meet Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2022,What happened in each case? So the Democrats at my college campus at Tufts, they do some events on campus, but they try really hard to get students to come with them to canvas in New Hampshire. And the students told them, you know, it's just too far away,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2040,we can't go to New Hampshire, we have classes, we have stuff to do. And so in the 2018 election, they never got more than seven students to get in the car to New Hampshire, which by the way is like an hour away, to canvas.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2052,And then the story goes that there was a Pete Buttigieg event in Manchester, New Hampshire, and so the student Dems said, okay, well, you know, does anyone want to come up to Manchester to meet Pete Buttigieg? We can take a selfie with him, post it on Instagram.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2067,And the student Democratic group could not find enough cars to accommodate all of the Tufts students who wanted to go and take a selfie with Pete Buttigieg. So perhaps the most elementary difference between those who think of politics as a means to power,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2087,as a means to affect policy, and those who think of it as an entertaining diversion, is whether people show up to vote. I understand that you run surveys where you ask people whether they voted, and then you compare what they tell you to records showing whether they actually voted.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2103,What do you find? So a lot of people, like almost half sometimes, of confirmed non-voters, that is people who the public record shows they did not vote, about half of them sometimes say they voted even when they didn't.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2118,And when a colleague and I tried to figure out who are the kinds of people that lie about voting, we discovered essentially college-educated news followers lie a lot. When they don't vote, they say they voted anyway. Uh-oh. Another piece of evidence you have about the rise of political hobbyism
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2135,is a decline in interest in any election that is not about national issues or national candidates. Can you talk about this for a moment? How has interest in local elections, like mayoral races for example, how has that changed in recent years,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2150,even as people have paid increasingly close attention to what's happening on the national stage? So a big part of that story has got to be the media. The media landscape is dramatically different. There's a lot fewer resources in local news and local newspapers,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2165,declining rates of engagement with even TV, local news. And there's a question about whether that, you know, how the supply and demand chain or the cause and effect relationship between interest in local news and availability of local news.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2184,But what's happened is that we have very, very few people voting locally and taking interest in what's happening in state and local politics. And so you have people, say on the left, who say, I care about the environment or I really care about racial equality,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2200,but I'm not going to pay attention to the ways my state or city might work on those issues. I'm not going to apply any pressure to my state legislator to work on those issues because what's happening at the state and local level is kind of boring.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2217,And it's just not as exciting as President Trump's tweets. And on the right, you see the same thing, but not as much. On the left, there's been this long history of particularly the kind of the well-educated wing of the Democratic Party pooh-poohing what's happening at the state and local level,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2236,saying, nah, all the interesting stuff's got to be the national stuff. So you're pointing to something really interesting, which is that political hobbyists might be found in all parties, but there are important differences between the parties, but also on other fronts.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2250,You find that political hobbyists are not distributed equally across the spectrum between men and women or between the rich and poor. Can you talk about those differences for a moment? Sure. So first of all, when you look at groups on both parties,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2264,particularly on the left that are involved in community organizing, that are involved in party committees and groups, you see it's mostly women. If you go to any of the indivisible groups which are popped up since the Trump election,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2277,it's about two-thirds women. But when you are online or you survey people about how interested they are in politics, how many facts they know about politics, that's predominantly men. You also see this phenomenon that, you know, if you look at, like, if you, you know,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2292,when I survey people and say, how much time are you spending on politics? You see the most time people are spending politics is among college-educated white men. And part of the story there is a racial story that, like, African Americans and Latinos
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2308,in the Democratic Party are spending less time, say, thinking, reading about politics, but much more time engaged in community organizations than college-educated white liberals. And the story behind that is about how satisfied you are with the status quo.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2329,And the folks who were pretty satisfied with the status quo talked a lot about important things, civil rights and so forth, but were much less engaged in empowerment. When we come back, the powerful implications of political hobbyism on both the left and the right.

This has nothing to do with identity politics. So the podcast has to do with people treating politics as more of kind of like a hobby
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2390,rather than like an actual fight for power. That like typically if people are engaged in like some sort of political activity, their goal ultimately is to shape policy. But nowadays, the way that people engage with politics is it's more just kind of like something you follow more recreationally.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2404,You don't really care at the end of the day, you know what the policy is. You're not really trying to change anything. You're just, you just are really invested in politics. It's kind of like a sports team would be.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2413,So like a difference might be that like if somebody on the national level is talking about politics, or I'm sorry, if somebody from a hobby point of view is talking about politics, maybe there are people that disagree with them and they're like, fuck these motherfuckers.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2425,Like I fought these little pieces of shit, blah, blah, blah. Like they're very invested, very my side versus your side kind of thing. But like at local levels when people are like actually going out and knocking on doors and stuff,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2435,that it's not typically like, oh, hey, I voted for Donald Trump. Oh, yeah? Well, you're a subhuman fuck boy piece of shit. It's more like, oh, you voted for Donald Trump? Well, can we come in and have a moment and talk to you about our candidate or whatever?
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2445,That more of like they're exercising politics in a different way and their goal is the acquisition of political power that when they exercise, when people that exercise politics for political reasons are doing it, the goal is to get more voters or to gain some sort of power politically
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2460,as opposed to a lot of people that practice it as more like a hobby where like they don't really vote or care about like the policy one way or another. It's more just kind of like rooting for sports teams,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2468,and that's kind of the end of their involvement with it. Yeah, okay. I BuzzFeed called them their forever shoes.

FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2513,This is Hidden Brain. I'm Shankar Vedantam. I'm talking today with political scientist Eitan Hirsch about the millions of Americans who engage in politics as a form of self-expression rather than as a mechanism for real change. Eitan says there is one central difference between hobbyists
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2531,and people who are serious about getting stuff done. The serious people are less interested in how they feel and more interested in acquiring and using power. Eitan met a man who was serious about that kind of power in the Boston area.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2545,He was known locally as the Ukrainian boss. So this man was a mystery to me. Someone told me there was this elderly man living in this neighborhood of Boston called Brighton who was somehow a boss, that he controlled a thousand votes.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2562,And I really wanted to figure out like who was this person? How did he control a thousand votes? So I asked if I could meet him. This man, his name is Nock. He came to the United States from the former USSR, from Ukraine.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2575,And he was a leader in a retirement community of mostly older Russian Jews in this neighborhood in Brighton. He was like one of the, you know, he organized community events. But in the 90s, Congress and President Clinton passed a welfare reform bill.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2592,And in the original law, legal immigrants, including those living in old age homes, were going to be turned away from benefits like food stamps or disability. And this was a major problem because for the folks living in Nock's building
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2605,and for many retired communities throughout the country, this was the main source of their food. And so there was panic. And Nock, as the community leader, he started to advocate a little bit, going on radio, doing some interviews.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2620,But he and his wife started to try to get as many people citizenship as quickly as they can. So a lot of these people were eligible for citizenship, but their English wasn't great. They had to practice for this, you know, 20 questions on a test
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2633,about the Bill of Rights and stuff like that. They had to be able to write a sentence, talk to someone. And so Nock and his wife trained all these people to take the citizenship test. And in a couple years, they got 300 of their neighbors' citizenship.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2655,Soon after, he decided to leverage his central point in this community for politics. He learned that, you know, someone who's in a state legislative office or on the city council can do a lot for this community, who care about, you know, certain policies like immigration,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2671,but they also care about transportation issues, you know, getting the snow shoveled to their building. And so Nock and his so-called lieutenants started filling out a sample ballot. You know, they would get a sample ballot. They would mark who they thought the community should vote for.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2686,They'd make photocopies, and they'd hand it out in their building. The building has about 1,000 people in it. The precinct voting booths are actually in the building itself. And so Nock and his lieutenants started getting out the vote among people in their building.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2700,And pretty soon, you can see this in the public records of turnout, Nock's precinct would have two or three times the voting rates of all the neighboring precincts. You start seeing politicians paying attention to him, calling him on his birthday,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2716,walking him to the grocery store. And, like, nobody knows about this guy, right? I mean, no one in Boston, outside of the political establishment, outside of his community, knows about him. But to his own community, he's a hero.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2734,Basically, he and his wife did decades of favors for people in their community and were really nice people. They built a lot of trust, and with that trust came the opportunity to influence people's votes. In other words, what he was providing to his community was really a form of service.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2755,It was less about saying, here's a set of values or ideological issues that I care about. It's saying, you know, there's a very humble way of thinking about leadership, which is, you care about the potholes, I care about the potholes.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2767,You care about the snow being shoveled, I care about the snow being shoveled. And it's less about Republican versus Democrat. It's less about big issues. It's much more, I mean, I suppose it's much more transactional. It's much more parochial and less ideological.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2781,That's right, but even if you cared about those ideological issues mainly, even if you did, the path to getting people to care about what you care about is still NAC's path. That is, if you wanted to move people on climate change, but it's hard to explain climate change,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2797,or you want to move people on, you know, a nationalized health care, but it's really hard to explain those details. Most people are not going to want to talk to you about that. But if you're kind to them, and you take them seriously,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2808,and you serve their more immediate needs, then when an election comes, even by the way, when there's not a celebrity on the ballot, they say, oh, I'll vote your way because you, NAC, the Ukrainian boss, I respect you.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2821,And you're telling me this thing to do, and I'll do it because maybe you know more about this than I do. Or, you know, maybe I should just go along with you because you've done so many nice things for me.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2833,So whether your goals are just fixing potholes or your goals are, you know, international climate change, the methods are very similar. The Ukrainian boss acquired power by providing basic services. Food stamps, snow shoveling, help with the citizenship test.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2854,By contrast, political hobbyists often get involved when politics is about what Eitan calls post-materialist issues. Take the kinds of petitions that people sign. A colleague of mine, Brian Schaffner, and I started looking into this petition program that the Obama administration instituted early on in his administration.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2876,The idea was on the White House website you could collect digital signatures, and if you got enough signatures, the White House would respond to you. And you could download the data on this, and so Brian Schaffner and I, we downloaded the data,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2892,and we started looking at, you know, what kind of petitions were being signed, how many people were signing them. And we discovered something that really amazes me still, which is that most of them were about really small and mostly frivolous things.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2907,Some of them were just jokes, you know, the U.S. should build a Death Star. But most of them were not like that. They were just about smaller issues, a problem of puppy mills or regulating of premium cigars, stuff that, you know, is important but doesn't affect the kind of, you know,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2926,the general welfare of someone who's struggling to get by. And so political scientists for a long time have noticed a shift in politics away from bread-and-butter issues, away from people getting food on their table and having good jobs and all that, and towards what these are called, you know, post-materialist issues,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2945,issues that are not about economic welfare or, you know, education, health, but there's other stuff. So I want to spend a little time talking about the role of money in politics and the relationship between money in politics and the rise of what you call hobbyism.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2965,You once conducted a survey where you asked people if they'd be willing to make a donation. I think it was $1,000 to attend a dinner with a prominent leader. And some people were told the money would go to fund a political campaign,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2977,but others were told the money would go to an event management company and in fact would have no bearing whatsoever, no impact on policy or electoral politics. What did you find? What's the guess? My guess is going to be that the two things were about the same,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,2996,that people just paid to see the politician or whatever, they didn't give a fuck where the money went. That's my guess. Let's find out. Good luck. Oh God. If they fund the dinner, they say no. Oh shit. Spoiler alerts.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3012,In that survey we found that almost as many people would give $1,000 to have a dinner with a politician even if the money wasn't going to the party. That is, even though in that situation the money wouldn't be seen by the politician
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3026,as something that they should reciprocate with favors, even if it didn't serve the interests of a political party or campaign, people were just willing to give money, so they said, to attend the dinner. And this is consistent with this general view of hobbyists in donations.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3044,There was just this story in the presidential primary about Pete Buttigieg hosting an event at a wine cave. And there's events like this all over the place, exclusive events for rich donors. And the question is, are those donors giving because they want to go to an exclusive political event
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3061,where they can talk about politics and take a selfie, just in the way that my students wanted to go to New Hampshire to take a selfie with Pete Buttigieg, or are they doing it to actually serve a political goal?
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3072,And of course, the answer is it's both. But this survey experiment tried to allow us to say, well, OK, well, how much of it is just purely entertainment? And the thesis then from this study is that some significant portion of these big dollar donations
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3086,are in fact tied to self-expression of wanting to say, I'm getting a photograph with a presidential candidate, not so much that I want some specific outcome from that candidate. That's right. So these are big money donors. And as people hear what you said, they might say, all right, this tells me that
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3103,small money donations are really the way to go. Those are the donations that are untainted by political hobbyism. But unfortunately, you don't agree with that. I hate my life and I am really depressed. Republican Congressman Joe Wilson interrupted a State of the Union speech by President Barack Obama.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3120,First of all, remind us what happened in that incident, what followed, and what it tells us about small money donations. Right. So Barack Obama was speaking before Congress about the health care law, and Congressman Wilson shouted at him from the seat in the House of Representatives saying, you lie.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3138,Those who are here are illegal. Lie! Lie! It's not true. And, you know, it was a departure from the norms of kind of appropriate behavior in Congress. But soon after, in the days following, Congressman Wilson earned $2 million in online donations.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3156,And this is consistent with what we see across the board in donations, which is the way to get a lot of money, if you're a politician, from small dollar donors is by being really provocative, by being outrageous, by doing the stuff that Donald Trump does.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3173,And it should be no surprise that the best small dollar fundraiser, you know, it's not Bernie Sanders, it's not Elizabeth Warren, it's Donald Trump. So the media, by your account, are both the beneficiary and the driver of political hobbyism.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3189,They encourage people to think of politics as a sport with daily winners and daily losers, different channels for fans of different teams. And you cite clips like this one from MSNBC's Rachel Maddow. CNN reports, and we have confirmed that Manafort has now settled into sort of his forever home at FCI Loretto,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3210,which is the Federal Correctional Institute at Loretto, Pennsylvania, which is about halfway between Harrisburg and Pittsburgh. Fun fact about FCI Loretto, used to be a Catholic seminary. Now it is home to Donald J. Trump, presidential campaign chairman, inmate number 35207-016.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3230,What does that clip tell you, Eitan? So I've learned exactly nothing from that clip, right? I've learned that Manafort went to jail. I didn't need to know his present ID number. If I did, I could just look it up. It's Googleable.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3244,I didn't need to know about the details of the prison. But that sounded like Rachel Maddow was just taking me on some deep dive. There were numbers read out loud. There were facts given to me. But it doesn't in any way help me be a citizen.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3258,It doesn't help me learn how to use my role. It doesn't help me learn about how I can engage in the political process. So what is it for? It's for entertainment. So we've looked at how political hobbyism can affect voters and donors and the media.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3277,And you've hinted at this in the past, but it also affects the behavior of politicians. What kind of positions does hobbyism encourage politicians to stake out? And perhaps just as importantly, what kind of positions does it discourage them from exploring?
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3294,Oh, Turkey Sticks donated $5. Here's my small money donation for Congressman Bunnell. Thanks, bud. So the main thing it does is it encourages politicians to respond to the short-term demands for instant gratification that the hobbyists want. If you know that the way to make a lot of money in small dollar donations is to be very provocative,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3320,to get a viral video of yourself yelling at someone, then that's what you're going to do. What came of the journalist that was in your home back in L.A.? Or a hearing for a Supreme Court justice nominee. That's what you're going to do in the debate stage.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3332,You know, we had this moment early in the presidential primary debate where Kamala Harris went after Joe Biden very harshly about this issue of busing. And it turned out the policy differences between them weren't that big. It wasn't clear in the end what Senator Harris' position was.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3347,But immediately after that debate, Senator Harris raised a ton of money online for people who were excited to see her so-called destroy Joe Biden. And so if we, the hobbyists, give that incentive to politicians, then that's how they're going to behave.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3365,You mentioned Donald Trump a second ago. I want to play you a short clip of President Donald Trump speaking at a rally in North Carolina some time ago where he singled out a Democratic congresswoman, Representative Ilhan Omar. Omar has a history of launching vicious anti-Semitic screeds.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3386,Send her back! Send her back! Send her back! Send her back! So when you listen to a clip like this, Eitan, you know, obviously the crowd is very energized by what President Trump is saying. But of course, it also energizes people on the left who believe he's singling out a congresswoman, a woman of color, treating her especially badly.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3406,And in some ways, it's a textbook example of how one comment from the president can trigger hobbyism on both sides. That's right. First of all, that whole scene of President Trump going to a rally and all those people chanting against Representative Omar,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3421,responding to Trump, singling her out, is really a classic example of the parallel between what's happening in politics and what happened in sports. I mean, it feels like a sports stadium saying, Yankees suck. It feels like that. And it feels like it can be dangerous, just like we have around the world, sports arena chants like that turning into violence.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3441,It can happen in politics, too. And on the left, we also have, you know, maybe a day after that of Twitter responses. And, you know, instead of spending time on thinking about what a voter can do as a citizen, or not just thinking about, but taking some action,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3462,we're wasting all energy on both sides arguing about this thing. I want you to read an excerpt from your book. I think this is on page 82 toward the bottom. It's the paragraph starting. So there it is. In many ways, I think it sums up what we've been talking about the last half an hour or so.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3482,So there it is. What news do political junkies demand? Outrage and gossip. Why? Because it's alluring. What news do we avoid? Local news. Why? It's boring. What do we think of our partisan opponents? We hate them. Do we really hate them? No.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3502,But politics is more fun if we root for a team and spew anger at the other side. It's easier to hate and dismiss the other side than to empathize and connect to them. When do we vote? When there's a spectacle.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3513,When do we click? When politics can be a frivolous distraction. When do we donate? When there's a cocktail party or a viral video. What are we doing? We're taking actions not to empower our political values, but to satisfy our passion for the sport of politics.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3535,When we come back, even as many political hobbyists expand their energies on the latest outrage on Twitter, Eitan Hirsch argues there are other people who are very serious about acquiring and wielding power. These are the people who end up shaping policy.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3579,Is this some mobile game? Oh, no, not good. I thought it was like one of those Korean MMOs. This is Hidden Brain. I'm Shankar Vedanta. Political scientist Eitan Hirsch makes the case that many Americans engage in politics in the same way that sports fans engage with their teams,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3611,as a form of entertainment and self-expression. At the same time, people who are more serious about acquiring and wielding power are quietly going in a different direction. Eitan says that in 2018, the Ku Klux Klan made the rounds in North Carolina.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3628,The group wasn't talking to people about racial issues, but something else entirely. Yeah, there were news reports that the Ku Klux Klan in North Carolina was going around with flyers targeting opioid addicts and saying, you know, do you have an addiction? It's not your fault. And we here at the White Knights, the KKK can help you through it.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3647,Why would they do that? I think they would do that because they know their path to getting more recruits, to building political power, is not necessarily by telling people that they have this hateful ideology, but by saying, hey, we're going to take care of people.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3662,And if no one else is taking care of people who are suffering from addiction, then they're going to get some people on their side. In many ways, it's actually the model of the Ukrainian boss, right? It's basically asking not how do I bring people over to where I am, or at least not asking that question at first, but really asking people, where are you?
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3681,What are the issues that you care about? What's happening in your life? How can I be of help to you in dealing with these issues and forming a connection with people? And then bringing them over and say, you know, we obviously have this connection. You should support me on this thing that I care a lot about.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3695,That's right. I think everyone who cares about politics, even if you're, you know, the classic hobbyist, you want to help people. And the question is, how do you do it? And what you see across the political spectrum, from the far right,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3708,you also see it across the world in groups like Hamas that have gained power in the Arab world. You see people saying, OK, we're not going to necessarily talk to you about ideology because, A, policy is complicated and ideology, you might not agree with us and everything.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3722,Instead, what we're going to do is we're going to try to take care of you. I remember a conversation I had with the anthropologist Scott Atran, and he has studied the rise of groups such as ISIS. And he told me that even though the group might have these really radical goals, the immediate practical thing they do is not talk about, you know,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3741,the destruction of infidels, but really they provide social services, educational services, a safety net, and the very kind of practical parochial issues that cause people to say, this is a group that really cares about us. That's right. And this is what political parties used to do back in the day when they were giving out, you know,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3759,free turkeys and vaccine shots and serving needs that the government eventually picked up some of those needs. But they were the political parties were the ones doing it. You see, that's what NOX doing, taking care of people. You have an interesting suggestion for both the Republican Party and the Democratic Party.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3776,And it's based on something that you noticed at Tufts University where you. GG, more like Cucks, GG. Good one. But where your school offers faculty members backup child care. What was the idea? So the idea is that, you know, where I work at Tufts, if I ever can't, if you know, I have three little kids.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3797,So this obviously really spoke to me. But this also is true if you have elderly parents that you're taking care of. If you ever need backup care, you can go to this Web site and Tufts will sub highly subsidize emergency backup care for something like 20 days a year.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3812,Now, I've never used this benefit personally, but it's important to me that it's there. It shows that the university cares about people who are taking care of their kids or taking care of elderly parents. And those who use it really do benefit from it.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3827,My suggestion was imagining political parties doing things like that, providing emergency child care and emergency elder care, maybe contracting with one of these companies that that do this. And by doing that, they're saying, hey, we have some big policy goals here.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3843,You know, maybe on the Democratic side, we really care about getting family leave passed in this country. And it might take us a little while to do that. But in the meantime, what we're going to do is we're going to show you as concretely as possible that we care about you and we care about these needs.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3860,And the way we're going to do that is instead of sending you like endless ads about how great we are, call us if you need a problem, if you have a problem. Tell us, are you going through something where you need an emergency backup child care provider, elder care provider?
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3877,Are you going through an addiction problem? Political parties should be at the forefront of solving these problems. And would this even be legal to do? So, yeah, it's complicated. It's going to be different state by state. But right now, there is a broad ability for parties to engage in what are called party building activities.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3897,They're not allowed to trade favors or give assistance in exchange for a vote in an election. But they're allowed to do stuff that promotes their party brand that says, hey, we're the Democratic Party or we're the Republican Party.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3911,And we care about you and you should like our brand. And we can run a pancake breakfast. We can host a carnival. We can we can do a whole bunch of stuff that is for that purpose. This is within the historical role of what a political party is supposed to do.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3927,So there are people who are clearly taking to heart the ideas that you're talking about in the book. You cite the example of an activist named Dave Fleischer. When he goes around canvassing, he tells people a personal story about his high school girlfriend.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3941,What's the story, Eitan, and why does Dave tell people that story? So Dave tells a story of his high school girlfriend and this very intimate story, really, about how he had a high school girlfriend to begin with. We later learn that that Dave is gay and knew he was gay from the time he was a kid.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3959,And he had a high school girlfriend because in high school, that's what he's supposed to do. To fit in. This is the 1970s. And he and his girlfriend weren't having sex. And he talks about that publicly and he talks about the fact that he didn't want to have sex with her.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3973,And she in the end felt bad that like what was wrong with her. And he tells a story to strangers at the door. Maybe he's canvassing on behalf of abortion rights. And he's saying, you know, I'm a gay man. What do I know about abortion rights?
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,3988,Well, I can tell you a story that really speaks to me about why I take a pro-choice position. And that my pro-choice comes from a position of understanding all the complicated reasons why people have sex, why people might accidentally get pregnant.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4004,All the awkwardness of and discomfort of being a young person, figuring themselves out. And, you know, God forbid that he did have sex with his girlfriend and she got pregnant. And, you know, later he had been hiding the fact that he was gay. It's, you know, a complicated situation.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4022,And he tells that story to someone who maybe is Republican, to someone who is pro-life. As a way to tell that person like, hey, this is where I come from. This is why like deep in my heart I have this value.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4035,And tell me about you and where you come from on an issue like this. And he tells the story, Dave tells the story to try to make a connection. Because on a lot of issues, the person at the other side of that door might not have a strongly held view.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4050,Or might have a view that changes in light of the story like Dave shares. Maybe they're really strongly positioned on this issue. And they're never going to, you know, they're never really going to move on it in Dave's direction.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4063,At least maybe they've built some mutual understanding with one another. Dave and the person at the door. On the other hand, it might be that this is the person who wasn't sure what they thought. Or had mixed feelings. And Dave's intimate story, Dave's story about his personal life,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4077,helps them see why this is so important to him. Dave's method is to say, well, let me be vulnerable to you. Let me open myself up to you. And in return, maybe you might do the same. And you might better understand why I'm talking to you about politics today.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4093,I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about the fact that this approach, which is sometimes called deep canvassing, was initially received with some skepticism in the academic community. But you say there has been subsequent work that has reestablished the value of this technique.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4108,Yeah, this was a strange situation for the discipline of political science. The initial studies of this were done by this grad student who ended up being a professor at the University of Michigan. And the initial studies were done by this grad student who ended up fabricating the data.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4127,And so the initial results, which were very highly publicized, were all retracted. The study was retracted. It was very embarrassing. But the people who discovered the problem, discovered it because they wanted to actually do it too. They discovered all these irregularities in the data when they tried to replicate what they were doing.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4146,And so when the scandal broke, these same scholars did a new study that wasn't obviously fabricated. That was very rigorously done. And they found similar results. That is that the deep canvassing is very effective. It's particularly effective at this at this very hard task of persuasion.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4166,The reason to do deep canvassing is not to remind people to vote. It's pretty easy to remind someone to vote. It's to convince someone to change their mind about an issue. And so deep canvassing is one of the most effective ways, if not the most effective way, to do that.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4183,Now, it's time consuming. It's hard to train people. It's hard to convince people to do this very awkward thing. But in the end, it's effective. So 2020 promises to be an intensely heated year when it comes to politics.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4197,And no matter what happens in the 2020 presidential election, it seems more or less certain that millions of people on the losing side are going to feel that fellow citizens have betrayed America and betrayed fundamental American values. True.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4210,The idea that ordinary people should reach out to their opponents, reach out empathetically. I'm wondering if a lot of people are going to say, you know, Eitan, that sounds like a pipe dream. I think quite the opposite. It's the only thing you can do.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4223,This book is written for someone who wants to understand their role in our democracy. Their role is not to follow what Trump does. No one is depending on them to follow the news about Donald Trump's tweets. No one is depending on them to have a hot take on Facebook.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4242,But there are ways in which they can be in communities where people are depending on them, depending on them to get to a meeting, to show up, to move policy in their direction. If they really care about something like climate change, guess what?
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4256,The regional transportation system in their state might sound boring, but it's pretty important to solving that problem. And they, as a citizen by themselves and the group that's organized locally, can have a role to play in that. They can help their own neighbors move forward on some issues that they care about.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4275,They have no role to play in the national political scene. Yes, they can vote, but no one needs them. The country doesn't need them to follow Twitter. But I would say that the point of this book is that to tell the reader,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4291,hey, like your country really does need you to do something, and it's not going to be following Twitter. It's going to be talking to your neighbors, building a community, getting organized, moving policy, doing what NAHT does, trying to get a thousand people.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4305,...and Lushik Waba, and edited by Tara Boyle and Raina Cohen. Engineering support from Andy Huther and Patrick Boyd. All right, guys, what did you learn today? I put the Hassan stuff in my title, the total clickbait, by the way.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4324,It's like a two-second clip. There's not much to talk about. I'm sorry, man. I'm a political hobbyist. A, the fuck men, boys. Go back to deploying your hot takes on Twitter. Fuck the system. Amen. Oh, the Hassan stuff was... I thought that was just kind of funny. Hold on.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4384,I don't know what that says on the side. Independent outlet, independent news outlet on the Internet. I would have to say that I think I'm doing pretty decently well for what has happened so far in my career. Not only that, but I also have an incredible community full of very supportive individuals who are putting,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4403,like, actual, putting their money where their mouth is, actually going out and fucking canvassing, actually going out and fighting for Bernie Sanders, and most importantly, doing cyberbullying on the Internet for the world's hundreds who get paid $600,000 a year to just fucking be really, really awful.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4415,Credit your mods, can't do shit alone. Wait, what the fuck do you mean? Of course my moderators are incredible, too. I just said my community is awesome. Basically, James Franco, you ruined it for you hot guys. Now you have to be quirky like Billy Hassan.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4422,What? Oh, OK. Anyway, I thought this defense was very interesting. Let me know if this sounds like anything you've ever heard before. It's not like... I mean, they're making a joke about... And I'm going to... Trigger warning. There's going to be a curse word in here. The F word is going to be featured in this.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4437,But like, people were very upset at this. I saw this as well. Bernie should get meaner. I'll quit my job in New Hampshire right now if he calls Buttigieg a F word. Like, so trans is a Trump card? No, like, they're obviously not anti-gay.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4450,They're obviously not homophobic. It's like a black person making a joke about a white person calling them the N word or calling their opposition the N word or something. Huh. Kind of weird. What a weird take. Huh. For the record, this is actually a joke that I think would be pretty funny, but I wouldn't say it publicly. I'd say it privately.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4478,But here's Hassan defending it publicly. It's very interesting, you know? Huh. Really makes you think there, huh? Huh. I got in an argument with this person. She said she couldn't be homophobic because she was trans. Oh, yeah. That wouldn't surprise me.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4498,I think Hassan follows her on Twitter, so he's, like, obligated to, like, defend her takes. Huh. I asked Peach about the Dan and Darius drama last night. What happened? Um, yeah, I think so. Probably by most definitions. I've said this multiple times, at the end of the day, politics doesn't—
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4536,If you're, like, wealthy, white, straight, or bi, I guess. I don't know what the fuck— Holy shit, I thought I just got perma-banned. I mean, at the end of the day, politics doesn't really affect somebody like me that much.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4546,Um, like, generally, like, I'm gonna be okay no matter what. Like, as long as you have money and you're, like, not, like, some fucked class. I'm not trans. I'm not black or female or whatever. Even white women do pretty good these days.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4558,Like, for the most part, um, yeah, I mean, I'm gonna be okay, you know? I would be lying to say that, like, I am 100% affected by the political status quo right now. And I think that, um, you know, blah blah blah, like, yeah, there's—
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4584,It would take some convincing me that Bloomberg would be a better president than Trump. Ugh. Why does Sean talk about American politics? Can't he go do his dumbfuck UK British bullshit or whatever? Would you ever start a book club for your boring philosophy shit?
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4606,Maybe someday we'll see. I.D. read it at that point and you could get, like, an audio sponsorship too. It's your civic duty— Ha! All right, dude. Ha! Yes, I see the Twitch money thing. Thank you. Why did you say what you said in that 2013 speech?
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4651,Um. Dan in Pichuchu drama last night was 10 out of 10 memes. Dan threatened to leak in 19-year-olds. Wait, what? Only Finns and she started crying and Dan wouldn't apologize. Bring them on, Abathur. Wait, what happened? I don't think those words reflect how I led the most diverse city in the nation.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4698,Mr. Mayor, why did you say what you said in that 2015 speech? Um. I don't think those words reflect how I led the most diverse city in the nation. And I apologized for the practice and the pain that it caused.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4722,But why didn't you say it? It was five years ago and, you know, it's just not— Man, I don't know if five years ago works when you're, like, 92 years old. That's like—now, if this guy was, like, 30, maybe 25, sure. 22, definitely.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4745,Like, 74? Like, man, that was back in my 60s, dude. Come on, like, I'm 71 now. Man, I don't know about that one. Hidden Brain is a good podcast. I learned a lot about human behavior from it on NPR.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4766,Nice. That's not the way that I think, and that's not the way it doesn't reflect what I do every day. Yeah. Back to the 2015 comments. So you have apologized for using and promoting your policy, if, stop, and frisk.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4780,But those comments on that audio, you know, they're more than just talking about stopping— I mean, they're pretty derogatory comments about African Americans and the neighborhoods that they live in. So beyond the policy, do you apologize for those remarks?
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4794,I don't reflect the way that I've governed or the way that I run my company or the way that I live. And I've led the most diverse city in the country, and the public there elected me and reelected me two other times.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4810,So I think they're pretty happy with me. But do you apologize for saying those words? I think the first part of the question, are you concerned that your comments might affect your performance with African Americans? I do not think so. I think people look at it, and they say that those words don't reflect Michael Bloomberg's way he governed in New York City,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4831,the way he runs his company, the way his philanthropy works. What? He must—OK. I can answer this question better on the spot. One, I know that's true. Two, he is a billionaire. And three, he's running for office. He should have an amazing answer pre-crafted for this from some guy that he's paying to help him with these PR issues.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4858,How is it acceptable? How could he possibly stumble through it? You know these are going to be brought up. You know this is going to be brought up. Like, why the fuck is he stumbling? He has to know this question is coming?
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4876,Oh, no, no, no. You're agreeing. He has to know. Yeah. He has to know these questions are going to be coming. How could he not? Is there a winning answer? Sure. Try to reframe it in a somewhat positive light.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4886,Emphasize on the fact that you disavowed those policies you didn't do in going forward. And then that's it. Like, it's a pretty standard. You shouldn't have to—the fact that he was asked that question— What you said in that 2015 speech.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4902,Like, why? What are you thinking about here? There's no way that you're blindsided by this. There's no way that you're like, oh, fuck. Oh, shit. They had—ah, fuck. They must have turned CNN on for more than two minutes. Fuck them. Fuck. Like, how could you not—how could you not know this?
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4920,This makes me think the debates are actually going to crush Bloomberg. It looked like reflective pause. No way. Not with the way that he fucking— I don't know. With it being just 2015, it's hard to spin? You don't have to spin it. Just own it and move on from it.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4937,Like, how—oh, he said those comments in 2015? That's harder. But, like, we were speaking about—I don't know what the exact comments are, but it was the comments where they're talking about, like, oh, high crime in high neighborhoods with black people, white people weren't policed enough or whatever.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4952,Like, I was having a conversation about the high crime areas that we had back then in New York. The phrasing that I used was callous and insensitive. The policies that I supported in my earlier days as mayor, I didn't support in my later days as mayor. I walked back on them.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4965,I got rid of stop and frisk in New York when we realized how disastrous the policy was. Going forward, obviously, I don't have any of these beliefs anymore, and I believe that my tenure as the second and third term mayor of New York reflected that, and that's it.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4977,Like, something like this would be, like, an answer that you would—you would have this prepared, like, 12 years in advance, knowing that you're going to get questions like this. But this, like, uh, that's not—I don't think he got rid of stop and frisk.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,4991,I think he did. I'm pretty sure Bloomberg did get rid of stop and frisk in his last term, didn't he? Like, this is literally, like, Hitler on trial. Like, if somebody's like, dude, what the fuck is your defense of being Hitler?
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,5004,Like, the answer you're going to give them when they're going to say, listen, Hitler did some fucked up things. I knew he was a bad dude. That's why I took him out. I acknowledge he did bad shit. I killed myself. Like, let's move on from it.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,5012,Like, that's it. Like, he got rid of stop and frisk. Like, yeah, I've made insensitive comments. I made comments that can be interpreted. You would never admit that they're insensitive, but, like, I made comments that can be interpreted in a very callous manner towards African Americans in my community.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,5023,That's obviously not the community that I think is reflective of the leadership that I had in New York. I got rid of stop and frisk when I realized how horrible it was. I disown any of those comments, and those obviously don't reflect the way that I feel today. Something like that.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,5034,Like, I don't know. Like, yikes. Bloomberg's forced to end stop and frisk by the courts? Doesn't matter. Average voter doesn't know that. Doesn't care. I don't get it. Why doesn't Mike just step up and say I lube black people?
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,5072,Bloomberg get rid of stop and frisk. I know he's not the one. My understanding is that Bloomberg, like, they, towards the later part of his administration before, they ruled that it was unconstitutional, that they did work. Oh my god, did I get banned on this? No.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,5084,That they were in the process of tailing it back or whatever. I would have to go and read exactly about it. But, like, regardless of what the answer is, what actually happened, like, this answer is unacceptable. Maybe Bloomberg doesn't want to win the presidency, just prevent Bernie, so Bezos builds a factory in New York, puts on Temple hat.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,5111,If anything, Bloomberg is helping Bernie, so I don't know about that one. Nice. Is Destiny 2 talking to League? I thought he said it out loud, but he didn't type anything. That used to be my mentality, but then I hated this community and I hate this fucking game, so I started talking in chat.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,5140,But today we're in a good mood, so we're going to go back to being chill, okay? Bloomberg can prevent Bernie winning enough delegates on the first ballot, so they screw him on the second ballot with superdelegates. I thought that they're not doing the superdelegate thing this time around.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,5178,Also, if anything, wouldn't Bloomberg be taking votes from other moderate Dems? Bloomberg isn't taking votes from fucking Bernie. If anything, he's weakening Biden or Pete's campaign. Hmm. Hmm. The thing is, I wanted to play bot mid, but you can't play bot mid, because if you queue for bot mid, you only ever get bot on top.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,5262,Learn top two? Well, that's why I got Vladimir. Can you not play the shit show champ Draven? What would you like me to play? AbsterHS and Twitch chat. Social acceptance has increased the amount of violence? Has it actually increased the amount of reported violence?
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,5307,Wait, what did that one guy tell me to play? You're not going to tell me? After telling me not to play this champ? Probably would have wanted me to play MF. There you go. I'm not going to play MF.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,5373,I'm not going to play MF. I'm not going to play MF. I'm not going to play MF. I'm not going to play MF. What does Hasan mean from the title? It should be updated, no? Did you say Hasan is a bad faith actor? Does he believe in everything he says? Oh, sorry, hold on. He probably believes in everything he says. I don't think he's intentionally bad faith. He's just kind of dumb and really negligent.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,5475,I'm not going to play MF. I think these people think they're doing the right thing. Their hearts are in the right place. Is he getting mad with Daph? No. The strategic decisions made by the party members are a little frustrating. Mr. Moon typically knows what to do. When Daph slept all of the melee goblins across the river, I was a little frustrated.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,5538,I must have rolled really low on my HP gains. Being level 5 with 23 HP is super AIDS. It sucks that I can get down so easily. I'm going to take the average. That's for losers. What do I get at level 6? I think level 6 sucks. I think I literally just get two stats.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,5593,My sneak attack doesn't go up. Oh wait, we got expertise. And your third proficiency sheet with thieves tools. Oh wait, proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make. At level 6 you gain two more of your proficiencies. You can choose two more of your proficiencies and skills worth of these.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,5627,What is your con mod? I think it's zero. I wonder if there's a way to get magical armor or something. My character is so- dude I have so many magical weapons. The only thing I almost got mad at is when Mr. Mootin also joined them in arguing that Daph should have the ring of water breathing.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,5657,Why the fuck would I give Daph a ring of water breathing who never would go on their own into something like that? What the fuck? That was so stupid. I almost got ultra triggered there. I was like, are you guys fucking serious?
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,5672,I don't know. It's hard to say. Chat post your reaction when Bernie forces Dan to pay for our free college. Pepe laughed. Because people like having magical items it makes them feel powerful. It's kind of shitty to hoard all the magical items because they make the most sense in you.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,5708,That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my entire fucking life. So like you want- who the fuck? Who opens with a pink like that? Like even though this magical item does fuck all on me I want it because it looks cool? That's stupid as fuck.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,5732,Oh my god. Your take is so bad people should play the game how they want. It's not always about min-maxing. Okay, well then your take is automatically bad because I'm playing the game how I want to min-max. There you go. I beat your argument with your own argument. Godstiny.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,5773,Maybe it's beneficial from an RP perspective? For Daph to have a ring of water breathing? How? Ugh we should not be trading. Um because Yuumi has heals and we don't have heals. We kind of have heals but Bard's heals are kind of shit.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,5807,They thought he was going to die in a storm on a boat? Dude we were in the middle of an ocean. You think he can just jump on the boat and swim to shore? Like what was the- fuck off dude. No way.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,5820,People just like magical items because they're fucking meme or whatever. I just want the people that can do the most with them to have a magical item. Like Mr. Moon is literally carrying around two magic swords when he can only use one of them.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,5829,And somebody wants to take my water ring when I've literally had like multiple missions that have taken me like through water at one point? No fuck that. That's dumb as fuck. Like Daph would never go on their own to do like any type of sneaking around like that.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,5839,That would only be my character. It makes the most sense for it to be on Nivus. Nicely done. It's not- well and it's not even like- I'm not even like min-maxing. I'm not trying to be like ultra efficient or whatever.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,5870,But I'm just saying like I'm not going to give the ring of- I'm not going to give like a ring of water bring that someone that never ever goes underwater. Like it doesn't make any sense. Why would I ever do that?
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,5882,I think that's pretty reasonable. Okay, this was really well done. Good job Bard. Maybe if someone had the ring they'd want to go underwater? Why? I have all the stealth abilities on the team. Like I'm the only one that has like the- like um- like all the stealth shit.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,5912,My- I think my stealth check is like- I think I got like a plus 9 to my stealth rolls or whatever. Fuck, not this one. Or I'm sorry, I got a plus 11 to my stealth rolls. Like no one else is sneaking besides me, right?
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,5943,What do you think is in the chest? It's probably just a little gold. I doubt it'll be like a magical item or anything. Something is going to be up with that sword. There's no way we've got a second plus 2 weapon. That's insane.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,5953,I've never seen so many things in a Koibu campaign before. So many magical items. This is so scary. Oh. I just want to play this really far back. The Nunu scares me. Also we should never- I don't think we should ever be able to kill that Vayne. We got really lucky last time.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,5975,We fucked up really good. Got him, boom. But Yuumi's going to heal up. Like this is so greedy. Why is she doing this? I wonder if we could have killed that Yuumi if we would have chased. Lee is chasing really hard. Chasing the Nunu out of the jungle, that's pretty good.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,6023,Get this Frozen back here. I think Yuumi's strengths lie in her ability to poke and her ability to regen and get you out of danger. Yuumi is not the best all-in champ. If you can poke him down first, all-inning with her ult is usually pretty okay.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,6048,Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah. No, no, no, no, no. That was too much. I'm holding too much gold. I'm encumbered. No, no, no, no, no. Dude, look at your life. Why is this guy pinging that he wants to go in?
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,6091,She has level 5. Does he have ignite? Oh, he does. We might have been able to win, but man, it's so risky. Why risk it? Like just fucking chill. Mute, I'm in! Why do you trigger Mutant so hard on perfect?
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,6131,I don't know. I shouldn't. Mutant is like the little brother I never had, okay? Oh my god, Yuumi, hello. Wait, for that please. Thank you. We're getting ganked. I think I'm gonna die. No, I'm good. Oh, use the creep. Oh my god, Rakan block. That was really good.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,6183,I don't think it'll matter, but... Oh my god. Wait, I might have been able to play that a little bit better. I might have been able to turn around and just fight. That was a really smart block by Rakan. Most supports would just dodge and then say, LOL you died, loser.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,6217,No! Fuck off, I'm MF, bitch. Go fucking CS. Can we agree that Warhorn has been a massive disappointment in terms of her strategy? I don't even know what the fuck her strategy is, but man, she fell off super fucking hard.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,6248,I think the ins and outs of why people do really well have to do a lot with the number of people they can get that actually work for them on the ground. Like to go out and canvas how many offices they set up in a city or whatever.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,6259,And I don't follow that stuff as much. I don't know where you even look that information up, unfortunately. I just go by what I hear on MSNBC and CNN and stuff. I'm sure that data must be collected somewhere in a more cohesive manner.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,6277,Hey, there's no excuse for us to not get this drake, but we're not going to get it, huh? Wait, my mental might be broken after just a single game. Yeah, my mental is going to be broken in one game. I just realized that my mid is 0-2, my jungle is 1-2, and my top is 1-2.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,6310,We've gotten ganked three times, I think. My jungle has never ganked me, and my top and mid are still losing horribly. Lee, wake the fuck up and stop doing golems. That should have been a free kill. There was no ward here. If Lee would have been here when Vayne pushed up, 100% free kill.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,6331,But he was too busy doing golems. My jungle this game is really bad. Nunu's can be bad, but it doesn't really matter. Their ganks are so good anyway. Their bot lane is 0-4, we're 4-1. Oh, come on, really?
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,6380,Oh, fuck. This Rakan is so good. But I don't know if it'll actually matter. The lane gank is too good. We're going to lose this game. My mental is broken. We're a strong enough bot lane that we should have every single drake.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,6417,We should have had the last one, but Lee is playing around, because for some reason, every jungle I have plays around mid and top. I haven't seen this in all games. Every trip bot is a double kill. Every time we go to drake, we should have it.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,6429,Or it's at least a good teamfight for us. But instead, Lee is only mid and top. It's insane. Oh, God. Why did he go back in? Oh, okay, he's okay. This is so scary. Oh, okay, Nunu is top. We can take this and then go mid.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,6487,Actually, I'm not going to go mid. I'm just going to do Golems instead. Wait, did Dante was going to leak Darius' girlfriend's shit or Peach's shit? Oh, God. What I'm really worried about is I think Vayne can actually 1v1 me, because it's Vayne.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,6524,She even has a level advantage on me. That's so disgusting. We both have one item finished. Her item is better for dueling. Her kit is way better for dueling as well. Oh, my God. That's not even close. They got Soraka.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,6595,We're going to lose this with Soraka dead? Hello? Vlad back? We are going to lose this. It's a third Drake. The Nunu is doing everything to win the game in our jungle. It's just whatever. We don't even have Tryndamere with us.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,6617,Third Dragon by 17 minutes. That's a good job on Nunu. That's just a jungle diff. I don't know what you're going to do there. Congrats to him. It's either Rapid Firecannon or IE next. I don't even know. This game is really disappointing.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,6667,What rank do people find nice on the base getting objectives around the map? I don't know. Dan wants to clean his name. Good evening, Steven. What up? Just being a normal person as usual. Why? I'm going to give the most honest accounting of what happened here.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,6698,Are you ready? I'm ready. I was on with Darius and his girlfriend. I'll try to give you a reenactment if you will to a certain extent. I'm talking with Darius and his girlfriend. Not the girlfriend. Sex partner? I don't know. Whatever you want.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,6720,They're not in a relationship. Comes on stream very upset for something. I'm not sure what. I said, watch your mouth. That's it. I'm leaking the only fans. No, don't leak them. Sorry, they're leaked right now. I'm leaking. Don't you know it.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,6732,The Patreon's next. That's it. I'm getting them now. No, don't do it. Sorry, I'm doing it and it's done. And then the clip comes up there and it looks very fucking bad. What happens immediately after that? I got the links. They're in chat. And of course, the link I post is download.com slash nudes.zip.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,6747,So that's the thing in question that people are losing their shit about. So why is it bad? Well, one, she's freaking out about these things being leaked, but it never happens. And immediately after the clip ends and after I do this, everyone knows this is not a real thing.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,6762,OK, so this was like 24 hours ago when this happened. No one's like, Dan, are you going to leak her nudes? Is that going to happen? Because everyone knew it was bullshit. But during this 30 second clip period, no one knew.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,6775,But that was the fucking meme resulting from it. But now, anyway, Pichudu came in and was like, that's really mean. You shouldn't do that. I don't know if she saw the whole bot or that. And I was like, well, we were all meaning, you know, I can't tell when these people are meaning or not.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,6788,Darius was eating cat food on camera and, you know, he made his girlfriend eat pulled chicken nuggets with M&M's. So, like, I have no idea what's real or not. I'm just I'm trying to play into it. And, yeah, now, of course, you have typical KO names and things like that out here trying to say, like, I'm extorting nudes for people, which is obviously not the truth.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,6807,Just meme it up. But anyways, there's a story. I hope everyone's happy. It's out of the way. Yeah. Are you excited? Was it everything you thought it would be? Wait, was this the night that I came on? Was this before I came on?
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,6821,I don't know. It's been like four days of fucking around with Darius, but it's getting too extreme, dude. I can't I think that the lesson I've learned here is that it has to be has to be people can't get involved in normies, man.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,6834,They can't. Actually, I don't know if they can. It isn't Darius as DGG as they come. Well, yeah, but people are saying like his Tinder or girlfriend isn't so. But anyways, I know more. No more interacting with Darius's girlfriend.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,6851,Stu Frisky or sex partner or whatever. Anyways, there it is. Good job, dude. You didn't Bloomberg that one. I'm proud of you. I tried. I got to be honest, though, I didn't speak up for Train when people came for him.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,6865,And now there's no one left to speak up for me. I feel bad. Wow. Nothing like a league stream to re subscribe. We need to. Hold on, Dan. Oh, my God. Finally, a good fucking fight. Just kidding. I don't even know what's killing me. They're also range.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,6896,When we get a good fight like that, we need to go. I shouldn't have died here. Maybe everyone was going as much as I could. Whatever. Go, go, go, Drake, Drake, Drake. Fuck everything else because you dumb fucks will lose it if you're doing dumb shit.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,6910,Just get the Drake. Good job. I might also for if we actually lose this. If Nunu fucking rolls his shit into here and we actually lose the fucking Drake. Oh, my God. Good one, Tryndamere. Okay, you guys should show.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,6955,This Vayne is living the true AD carry life. She's just off solo farming fucking everything. She's almost caught up to me. Barely 25 CS ahead. Dude, that cat character is not fun to play, by the way. You missed the part where she was crying on stream and asked for an apology and you didn't give her one.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,6976,And then she said she was going. You suck, Vlad. Did you take some SSR? I missed the part. I'm an asshole. Sorry, guys. Wait, which part? What did that donation say? She said she was crying on stream and threatened to kill herself, which is the most bullshit.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,7002,No, it's for a person that loves attention. I wouldn't believe anything. Whatever. I also don't care that much about Darius and his friends. What is happening in this game? Oh, God, I'm getting triggered. I need to stop trying to lead fights because this trend is off in his own fucking world.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,7022,To be fair, Darius is psycho too, so I don't know. Wait, do you think he's actually crazy? Yes, Darius is. Well, they're not crazy. They're just teenagers, very obviously. He's 23. He's not a teenager. Whatever. He acts like a teenager.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,7048,I can't talk to you. I'm going to the gym. What the fuck? I'm okay with forfeiting this game. None of these people deserve this win. All three of the other people are fucking brainless. This game was 100% in the lead.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,7104,If he would have just played around the drakes, we would have been in such a better position. But for some reason, my jungle is always... My Rakan was really good. For some reason, the jungle is always just playing mid and top. I don't know why.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,7129,We had such a good lead on the bot the entire game. This Ori got fucking huge. It's so stupid. That lead didn't play for anyone? Yeah, I don't know what the fuck he was doing all game. Jungle is like the solo champ that matters for the first 15 minutes of every league game.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,7146,Jungle sets the pace for every single part of the game. It's insane. Jungle determines who gets Herald, who gets drakes. It can determine lanes. It's insane how powerful jungle is for the first 15 minutes. And after that, no one cares about jungle.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,7174,I'll be right back. One second. One second.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,7259,PAPEA ALWAYS WIN! PAPEA ALWAYS WIN! PAPEA ALWAYS WIN! PAPEA ALWAYS WIN! PAPEA ALWAYS WIN! PAPEA ALWAYS WIN! PAPEA ALWAYS WIN! PAPEA ALWAYS WIN! PAPEA ALWAYS WIN! PAPEA ALWAYS WIN! PAPEA ALWAYS WIN! PAPEA ALWAYS WIN!
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,7650,PAPEA ALWAYS WIN! PAPEA ALWAYS WIN! PAPEA ALWAYS WIN! PAPEA ALWAYS WIN! PAPEA ALWAYS WIN! And the reason I can say that's not... Did you speak to her? What makes you believe that? We kept talking for a day after that and never once was it brought up that this was serious
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,7673,until you reached out to her. Sure, but did you ask her whether or not she found it serious? Well, I don't think... Because I spoke to her directly and she thought that it was serious even after that conversation.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,7686,So, as someone who's just making assumptions over the way that she was behaving versus someone who directly reached out to her and had her herself voice how she felt... Yeah, but I think that would be the natural thing.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,7698,Like, you know, if someone reaches out to you, I think you would probably be like, Hey, you know, I don't know. No, not necessarily. I don't think that she would lie. Do you think that she would lie about taking you seriously?
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,7711,And about being stressed and anxious over the situation? I can't say, you know, because it's hard to say. Okay, because I don't think that she would. Well, if she did take it seriously, then that certainly wasn't my attention.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,7724,And I thought that would have been implied with the idea that afterwards I posted in chat download.com slash nudes.exe or something along those lines that this was not serious. And it wasn't brought up again, I don't believe, afterwards.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,7739,Okay, here. I'll put... What do you want me to send the clip link? I mean, I'm seeing it. Here. Okay. I make a habit of downloading my clips, thankfully. Great. Yeah, I've heard this. So essentially... Yeah, I know, but I'm just...
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,7763,Look, if you were just trying to... All right, I'm gonna listen to this one sec. You got something to say? Hey. Hey. Hey, if you think you're gonna come home... No, no, you shut the fuck up. Oh, I'm going to OnlyFans.com?
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,7776,What's it like again? I'm getting yelled at? I'm gonna go start right now. You don't fucking threaten to do that shit, do you know how fucked up that is? I'm doing it right now. You better watch your tone, young lady, or I'm gonna go to Patreon next as well.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,7788,I expect a nice tone. What the fuck is wrong with you? I'm on both sides purchasing now, PayPal. You know what, Darius? Is it? Darius, I'm not kidding you. Wait, wait, wait. I want you out of my fucking life!
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,7802,You're ruining it! Wait, can we chill? Okay, we repaired the clips. You know what, rethinking it, I think it was clear that it was... Yeah, you know what, I hate to say it, I feel like it's very clear that that was obviously not real.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,7817,You know what? I feel like it was clear and then me posting download.com slash nudes.zip, like, come on, man. That was very crystal clear that that was a joke. Yes, it was and it was never brought up again, she didn't believe it.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,7831,But she did. You keep saying that she didn't believe it but she did. If she did, I apologize if she thought that that was the case. You should really stop saying that she didn't believe it because as someone who is making
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,7842,that assumption versus someone who's spoken to her directly, I think that she has the authority to say how she felt and what she thought. Okay, well, I mean, it just it doesn't kind of back up but sure, if she believed it, I...
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,7858,No, you know what? I agree with you. One second. If she believed that... Me viewing the clip and me viewing the VOD with the recognition that she was angry before the call, like, the VOD got deleted and the clip got deleted almost conveniently.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,7876,But so we can't go back and see the full context. We can only make claims into it. The other VODs are up. This one just got deleted straight after we had that conversation on stream, which I'm just saying is a very convenient happening but she was angry and upset before she hopped
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,7894,into the call. Before, Darius said something like, do you want to speak to her? And you said, I don't want to talk to that b-tch. And then she hopped into the call and she was very angry about something and then you
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,7908,said for her to change her tone of voice or else you would... I listened to the clip. I don't need to hear it a second time. Because of the context of her actually literally being upset, not putting that up like that
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,7921,emotional, like she was genuinely upset it wasn't an act for her. And she was actually angry when she hopped into the call. That conversation seemed real because she wasn't memeing about being upset either. And that was just from my perspective.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,7935,I guess everyone can take their own interpretation of whether or not it seemed like a joke, but at least I and some other people that messaged me to make me aware of the situation did not think that you were joking.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,7947,And if you were joking, you have a responsibility to make sure that everyone's on the same page or not say that kind of stuff. Like she thought that you were being legit. It wasn't clear that you weren't. And even now she's now scared.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,7964,Am I just going to get lectured or is this a conversation? Sure. But she's... One sec. She's now scared that someone's actually going to do it. Okay. Why would you be scared of your OnlyFans getting leaked if you do OnlyFans?
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,7979,How fucking stupid you have to be for that? No, she's scared that like because of the fact that someone's going to try to actually directly because of this go and like actually act that out. Didn't she say she made $100 a month off of this also?
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,7993,Hold on. That's not the point. It doesn't matter. Wait, the point, wait, how could you be scared of someone leaking your nudes when you post them publicly? I don't understand. Not leaking her nudes in that sense, but like her loss of income.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8003,Like this. She's not like... Okay. Like the loss of income. If someone goes... Wait, did you lose all of your OnlyFans if someone posted? No, it's just this is like a thing that everybody does. This is like stand.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8015,It's like industry practice. Like people like rip your shit and upload it all the time. Like it happens to anybody. Like, yeah, so... But it's bad. It's a bad thing that does negatively impact people's business. I mean, if she's only making like $100 a month, there's a good chance that anything that gets
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8028,posted publicly of her would only help her actually. Like, I mean, if you're only making $100 a month. She came in and she made her name. I don't know if she made her name in DGD, her OnlyFan name.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8037,Hold on. Okay, well, we can, you know, we can find out. I don't know. This is not a big deal either way. She came into DGD and made her name. Hold on, Pijuju. Okay, wait. She made her name, her OnlyFan name.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8047,Okay, so obviously she wanted the exposure. First off, I don't think this is the destruction of her OnlyFans. Either way, if anything, now she has more attention as a result of this. Next thing is that she was still memeing during this whole thing afterwards.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8060,I mean, even if that wasn't the case, I never claimed to be like a wholesome, precarious streamer. I'm an asshole. I think you're the strongest claim. The strongest argument here is that the girl is like very clearly like has like the emotional
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8072,maturity of like a teenager and that you shouldn't talk to her at all just on those grounds at all. Yeah, I'm not going to anymore. Yeah, the idea of like hardcore victimizing her is like blah, blah, blah. Like she's like, it's like she's like screaming and like going like crazy drama whoring.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8085,Like I don't mean whore like whatever, like crazy drama mongering, like insane. Like I don't think that she like is like seriously hating it. Like she gets off on it to some extent as well. I mean, like your strongest argument is just like it's clear that she's like very young
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8098,emotionally and so you shouldn't be talking to her at all on those grounds. That's the only thing you can say legitimately. I and I've already I said that that was the case. I just I don't like this whole idea that everyone took it seriously.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8108,It was, you know, wasn't just her. Everyone thought this was a real thing. I was going to you can't be like in a public discord, like screaming on people's streams about how like you want a private call and blah, blah, blah.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8117,Like it's just it's very it's just very like attention like seeking behavior. But I don't know that she was trying to content or like content bait or get more exposure for her. Like it seems like here's an example of Darius, like genuinely, like she's emotionally invested
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8135,in it, something like, yeah, but like here's like an example. If I want to have an actual if I wanted to have a private conversation with you and I really wanted to, I would message you right now and say,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8143,hey, this is what we need to talk about later. But I was on a call with them for like an hour. And this girl was like, Darius, I need to talk to you offline. I need to talk to you privately.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8152,And there's like, oh, can you tell me what it's about? She's like, I'm not going to tell me what it's about. I just need you after this. But like, it's like it's like very obviously, like attention seeking behavior,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8159,like very, very, very obvious, like not like this could be interpreted one way, but like it's just pretty obvious. It's just like something they do for whatever. But it could also just be because she's like literally a teenager,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8167,like teenagers do that. Should I remember people in high school doing that shit? But does like the attention seeking behavior, like justify what happened, like making some sort of like a joke like that? Um, not really like Dan should do like Dan should know better than to behave that way.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8185,But she's not like some like poor, like little victim. That's like just getting taken advantage of. Like she's like, it's very clearly like part of what she does online. I mean, she shouldn't. She doesn't have like the emotional maturity to like engage in that type of behavior.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8198,But yeah, it's not like she's just like some random passerby. And Dan picked this poor victim out of nowhere. I don't have very much sympathy for people like this. Sure. Yeah. And I also think that like other things that were problematic were like the ways that you
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8211,specifically Dan were speaking about her in DGG, like when you said or when you referred to her as Darius's flashlight. I don't know if like this is like trying to cancel me or something. Like if she can call me fucking micro Dan and call me and say I have a small dick,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8225,it's fucking game on. Okay. That's the way that's equal rights. I'm no, I'm good with that. I stand by that comment. Do you stand by that comment? I think she wants to say I have a fucking tiny dick.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8236,I am not a nice person. Wait, Dan. Oh my God, you suck at this, Dan. If she's like, if she's like started saying like micro Dan or some shit, Dan can call her a whore if he wants to.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8245,That's 100% legit. In this conversation, as far as I saw from the logs, he wasn't speaking to her. That was when she wasn't present. He was just speaking to like DGG in general. And he was speaking about Darius.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8259,And then he said he referred to her as his flashlight. So it wasn't in the middle of a conversation. And there are other things like really sexual comments that were made about her. It just seemed like really, really strange and potentially harmful and hurtful.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8277,Also, it's not an attempt to cancel you. I don't think that like you go through my logs from 2015. If you think this is the worst shit. I mean, like I'm a big fan of like, there's something called equal exchange.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8288,Okay, if you like are if you go down like a certain road in terms of insulting people, then you just have to accept it back like full stop. Like, I don't know, like if you're making fun of like somebody's dick size or whatever,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8297,which is fine, I guess, like it's part of the internet. But like, you got to be ready to get it back then if you're going to go that route, like being called a whore or whatever is like in line with like calling saying someone is
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8306,a micro dick. Like I think that's a perfectly decent exchange. It wasn't. He didn't call her a whore. She referred to her as Darius's flashlight. Yeah, we're just very objectifying. Yeah, of course. But so it's like, but yeah, but but talking about the size somebody's dick is also like
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8321,body shaming. I mean, like, sure, but I feel like insults at someone's appearance are less like dehumanizing and being objectified. I totally disagree with that one. Really? Yeah, I mean, like insults about people's appearances. I mean, like, we can get into like transphobia, we can get into like, certain types of shaming.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8343,Like there's a lot of stuff that goes into somebody's appearance, like the idea about someone's appearance. It's never just about someone's appearance. There's so much more that goes into that, right? Yeah, I understand that if it comes down to like something like transphobia, homophobia,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8353,racism, those things are obviously more intense. But if you're saying, oh, well, you're like ugly, where you're you have like a really large nose. I don't think it's a step in one direction to go from like, oh, like you got a tiny dick
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8364,and like, oh, well, you're a whore. I don't think that that's like one jump huge from the other. Like if you're going to go down, like calling someone like a fat fuck or making fun of a small dick or some physical feature, and it was like, okay, whatever you fucking slugger
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8375,it or like, I think that these are about on love. I don't think one is dramatically worse than the other. I don't think. Anyways, let's I don't want to like make this like she wants attention. That's fine. If she doesn't, if she doesn't, I'm not going to talk to her again.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8386,So it kind of solves the problem. And also I'll put this out if she's watching or maybe I'll tell her directly. If you took what I said seriously, I'm sorry. I was entirely meaning and I don't mean any of that stuff.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8395,I'm not downloading your OnlyFans or anything along those lines. I thought that was apparent. And if it wasn't, that's my fault. That's my fault. I'll try to be more clear when this happens again. Hopefully not in the future.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8405,I apologize. That's good. Yeah, I just wanted to come on to the podcast yesterday. You're way down. I thought yesterday I was under the impression that the before we spoke that it was like actually literally serious. And when I asked you firstly on the.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8423,Oh, well, I thought I thought you were serious. And so I was like, holy shit. Like, okay, I didn't know you were joking because I haven't interacted too much. You're like, hey, I want to come into it's a discord voice.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8432,And I was like, oh, shit. Shit's about to pop off. You know, like, are you serious? Like, fuck, yeah, I got that shit. Putting it on 4chan now. And you're like, what? And I'm like, oh, wait a second.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8440,What's happening? Because I thought that you're being serious. So that's why I thought that that was like so bad. Because if if someone threatens to leak someone else's like content online, like a sex workers content, I think that's really, really bad.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8451,And so I just wanted to let you know that that was not okay. That's it. Okay. Yeah. Consider reaching out to her, though. And like, if you don't do it, then she's definitely not worth ever apologizing to 0%.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8468,Don't do it. I'll think about it. I appreciate it, though. Don't do it, Dan. Don't give in. We'll save you from the canceled. Gotcha. Listen, okay, I take issue with people like. Like when people just like automatically go to like, like trying to cancel someone as
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8488,if like pointing out harmful behavior is always an attempt to cancel. I think that you can try to bring like harmful or dangerous behavior or like things that are wrong. I think that you can point them out without trying to like completely cancel an individual.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8501,Just bring it to light. Say, hey, this is wrong. Most people can change. I realize that what they do is wrong, but it's just important to pick it up. That is all. Good CC stacking. Nice job. Well done, you two.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8533,Exemplary work. Okay, well, I just came in to cancel me. My perspective. Yes, you're canceled. This is pizza. Joe Dan is over. Well, that's it. The end of the fucking I know. 10 days and 90 is over. I'm done screaming.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8553,Okay, cool. All right. That was exciting. Thank you. Be careful. Bye. Is this what it's like? The team is a fucking cast it and fuck me. Wait, when you had the squirrel, you went through that times 100 like every day, huh?
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8574,Something like that. I'm done. God damn it. It's done a decent job so far. I really wish you wouldn't have like, I'm not too sure what happened in the beginning of the game when she like fucking entered, but guys, if you're going to gank bot, when
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8622,you proc that flower, the gank is never happening. Just FYI. When you proc the vision thing. Oh my God, I'm dead. He's going to get a quadra kill. And now the game and now the game is over because it's casted.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8668,And so it's an auto loss. Oh, and I'm a good job. Lex. Next, you should ask Dan why he made the 13 year old boy pretend to be a girl and act sexual towards grown men on Russ Pepe.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8700,Oh, thank God they're actually doing it. My whole team. They went to the Drake. We got a free kill. We got a free drink and infernal. It's beautiful. I can't believe it. Oh my God. I just don't know what to say.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8726,I don't know what to say on this momentous. On this momentous day. Oh, that's what I can say. I have a 0% chance of winning this fight. Good job. She missed her fucking trap. Oh, cool. Cassadin shows up, picks up a free kill.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8756,Oh, she flashes even though the ult's gonna kill her. Nice job. I shouldn't be in lane without Lux. This Lux has spent a lot of time in lane without me. I think our backs, I don't know if our backs are just mistimed or what, but we're like oftentimes not in lane together.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8770,It's really, really weird. It's really fucking irritating too. I can't stand in lane with a Leona. Oh no. Oh, there she goes again. I can do it alone with Caitlyn, but... This is good. He's getting turret platings. God, Caitlyn. Shit, Caitlyn picked up so many kills.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8806,I don't know why Lux is like holding mid. Like, this is irritating because if Leona walks into lane and I don't see her in like a bush, like I just die for free. There's nothing I can do. I'll go back and get boots I guess. Caitlyn is top.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8826,Oh, I'm in lane. Canceled on. Kuman Scrum. Bonus meme. Steven. You need Sagittarius, you remind me so much of my ex. Oh my god, nice. Good one. I'm a big astrology guy. God damn guys, what the fuck is going on?
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,8898,My Lux is not here again. Where the fuck is she? This is getting really fucking annoying. Okay. I guess I can just go be mid. Like I have no fucking gold. Oh, okay. Leona is going back. Okay. Where the fuck did that Kassadin go?
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,9016,God, having Renekton here would be so nice. We're not going to pull it. Oh, we did a little. Wow, they all walked away from it. Why? Oh god, and of course it's resetting. Can we not kill Kassadin? Nobody? No, we're all just going to eat his optimal AoE everything. Okay, that's good. Nice.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,9050,Hey, there's Renekton. Hey, he showed up a little bit. Imagine being Kassadin, rushing Roa and fucking Tear and going 10 and 2 against a fucking Katarina. How does that even happen? How is it even possible? Nice. There's literally nothing I can do.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,9140,Oh god, get me the fuck out of this hellhole of a game. Leona and Kassadin on the same team, neither get banned. I still don't know how Katarina lost so hard to a Kassadin. I got bot turret at least.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,9177,Wasn't Kassadin hard counter Katarina? Why? How? Rushing the two greed items? How? I thought Kassadin was supposed to be pretty weak early game. Isn't Katarina pretty decent? Can Q stop her ult? What part of ult is early game?
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,9214,Wait, can somebody link me the lane matchup win rates between Kassadin and Katarina? I'm curious, I want to see it. If Katarina loses lane to Kassadin, why the fuck would you ever play Katarina? Why not just always play Kassadin?
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,9255,Great game guys. God, these games feel so fucking pointless. I have like no influence over anything. Unreal, dude. Oh my god, this is fucking cringe as fuck.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,9452,One last job Damien, and then I promise you'll never hear from me again. Well, maybe you will once you hear the numbers. 16 an hour, plus tips. Gastropub, burgers, beers, you know the deal. They let you pick your own hours.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,9480,I'm not a fan of the IPAs. The owner is Beatriz Groger. Groger? But she's retired. Not anymore. Alright Abrams, what's the catch? Of the day, sea bass. Classic, I'm in. That's all I needed to hear. Oh, and Damien, don't bring a gun to your new job as a waiter at a gastropub.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,9499,I'm not a fan of the IPAs. Interestingly, he essentially voiced the criticism of Jordan Jesus smuggling, but in reference to politics. The problem with what Jordan Peterson does is Jordan Peterson makes a lot of descriptive claims, but he never makes any normative claims.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,9530,So Jordan Peterson will say things like, women are not as happy today as they used to be, women and men don't get along in the office, men tend to be better at this thing. And that's all he ever says. He never goes, he never takes a step further to make a prescriptive claim to say like, what should we do about something?
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,9538,And the problem is a lot of people will take the things that he says, and then they like jump to very bad places. Kind of obviously, it's where you would expect someone to go based on what he said, but then he never takes responsibility for any of the kind of normative leaps people make off of his descriptive ones.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,9545,And that's kind of the annoying thing with dealing with Jordan Peterson. And here, Destiny is, as he often is, bang on the number. And that's not what you act like in your tweets, dude. So, when the heroine finds herself in a dark corridor, the score volumes down, and as she looks around blind corners, the ambient sound swells, and suddenly we can hear her breathing, until...
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,9582,Well, you know what happens next. But why? Well, because you've seen a movie or two before. And because of that, this particular horror movie doesn't have to explain to you that you should be anticipating something being loud and jumping out.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,9593,It can use...shorthand. It's like how every time attention is drawn to a character coughing, we can be sure that they're actually quite sick. Or when an overworked woman bumps into a man and drops her papers, and he helps her pick up, they're probably going to fall in love.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,9605,That one even has a name, it's called a meet-cute. Generally speaking, any given film won't be the first film an audience has seen, and the cinema has been plagued with cliches since the dawn of time. So when writing a screenplay, a lot of unnecessary exposition can be saved by using this kind of film shorthand.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,9617,But it's a bit of a double-edged sword. Maybe your audience hasn't just seen a lot of movies, maybe they've seen a lot of YOUR movies. If you've developed a reputation for having twists at the end of all of your movies, then having an audience full of Sherlock Holmes who are trying to pre-solve the twist can really reduce its impact.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,9631,So relying too heavily on this kind of film shorthand is a surefire way for you to get the complaint that your film was too predictable. Another film shorthand with a proper name is The Chekhov's Gun, which states that every element in a story should be necessary, and unnecessary elements should be removed.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,9644,So if we see someone at the beginning of your movie putting a rifle over the top of the fireplace, then before that movie's over, that rifle needs to go off. God, I said the cap slips off the poison pen for no reason, didn't I?
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,9653,I know, I know, but I just assumed that if anything bad happened, it would've been... No, do not say The Chekhov's Gun, Cyril. That, sir, is a facile argument. So for instance, in James Cameron's Avatar, Natiri tells Jake Sully that although everybody writes the pterodactyls,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,9666,only the bravest and greatest warriors have ever written the big, super scary, juiced-up pterodactyls. And you can probably guess what happens before the movie's over. Now, a clever writer can use these kind of film shorthands to their advantage by writing a script that assumes the audience has seen movies before.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,9679,They can avoid being overly predictable, but they can also use the audience's assumptions against them. In the anime Black Butler, Cielo's family is murdered, and he's left to die. But before he does, he offers a demon his soul to eat in exchange for revenge, and the demon, Sebastian, agrees.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,9693,Over the course of the story, the two become a buddy-cop pairing, and they grow to be very fond of each other. And if you've seen Planes, Trains, and Automobiles, or any of its million remakes, then you've seen how this generally ends.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,9703,There's something driving a wedge between the characters in the beginning of the story. How do I know you won't let me fall after you grab the rope? But they grow so fond of each other over the course of the story that at the end, rather than part ways, they decide to remain friends.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,9714,Ha! Boom, baby! Ha! Boom, baby! So what happens after Ciel and Sebastian find the murderers and get revenge? Sebastian eats Ciel's soul. The story hopes that you'll assume that Sebastian would never do such a thing, and so the biggest twist is that there is no twist.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,9729,The twist that you were sure was coming. So will it hurt? It will a bit. I'm sorry. And the thing about film shorthand is that the lexicon is growing every day. A relatively new addition is the one I like to call...
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,9740,Iron Giant-ing. Let's see if you can guess what it is. The Iron Giant is a story about a boy and his robot. After hilarity ensues, the end of the movie comes and everyone's about to be nuked by a missile.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,9749,As it looms down towards the town, the Iron Giant decides to sacrifice himself and fly fist-first up into the missile. You stay. I go. I love you. After a teary goodbye with his best friend, he closes his eyes, flies towards the missile, and says...
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,9772,Superman. Then dies and everyone's safe. Holy shit! Powerful stuff. But alas, at the very, very end, we see the boy wake up in the night because he hears a knocking sound. Turns out that it was a screw left behind by the Iron Giant, who is being slowly rebuilt bolt by bolt up in the north.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,9794,I was stressed out for a second. But 9-year-old me can dry his tears because it turns out that our robot boy is going to be just fine. But even when I was a kid, I didn't forget that that felt a little bit cheap.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,9803,And so we fast forward to the Avengers. Tony... Okay, hold on. I need to actually like... I need to just die, I guess. Okay. Shouldn't have chased the Udyr. Tony Stark finds himself flying into a wormhole on a mission to save the world.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,9841,He attempts to call Pepper Potts, but it goes to voicemail. So he leaves the saddest voicemail anyone's ever heard. But before the tears can well up in my eyes, I have this nagging remembering feeling about the Iron Giant.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,9854,And oh, oh, okay, he didn't die. Alright, well. Fast forward again to Guardians of the Galaxy. Groot's about to use his final move to save all of his friends. This time, even Rocket tells us that he's for sure toast.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,9866,You can't. He'll die. But I watch with skeptical hippo eyes as I think to myself that... He's probably just going to find the Fountain of Youth instead. Star Wars Rise of Skywalker irons two of its characters in the same movie.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,9879,And the reveal that they weren't really dead or amnesed permanently happens like within minutes of you thinking that they were dead in the first place. What are you doing there, Etrefio? Taking one last look, sir. At my friends.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,9896,So I'm trademarking the phrase Iron Giant in that a movie goes for a fake-out death so that they can get a cheap emotional impact out of you. It's a real pet peeve of mine because now that I anticipate it,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,9903,I end up losing any of the initial impact they wanted me to have until the credits start rolling. If you've seen my earlier video where Pirates of the Caribbean did a fantastic job of killing Barbossa, then there's kind of a minor version of this when you bring that character back in the sequel.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,9914,It's still a little better because at least I get to hang on to that emotional impact of them dying in that movie and they don't come back before the credits are over. But all it really does is borrow some time until we do get to that next movie and then it makes you go,
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,9923,Oh, come on! So what are some of your pet peeves that have to do with shorthand or cliches? I'd love to hear them in the comments. I'm Chad. Till next time. Good one. Chad. Jesus, this Thresh is a fucking monster.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,9963,No, I hit a... Oh, close. Oh, no. Oh, wait, he can do it. No! Holy shit. This Thresh is unbelievable. This Thresh is fucking on some shit. If he could flay him away. Oh, no, he doesn't have the mana.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,10024,Only 30 mana. Wow, nice flash, dude. You're such a great fucking player. All right, we can win with this Thresh, okay? Wait, we're finally seeing practical use of what? Of Boston Dynamics. Oh, I think I've seen that done.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,10063,We have to all-in her, like, very, very soon. Otherwise, she's going to regen it all back. Oh, my God, he just... The Thresh, the Thresh train. I don't think we can. I think I lost too much HP on my all-in.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,10095,Unless he lands a god hook. Oh, no. Imagine having a jungle that wants to do objectives. What the fuck? Is this the golden game? Why are you eating? Why did you eat three of these? Okay, I better do it here.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,10202,Get IE. What's the most common item first on Tristana? The one... This thing feels really good. Or is that a real wrapper? Holy shit, look at this guy. Wait, where's your ult? I lost vision. Why didn't he drive his ult?
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,10228,That should have been a double kill. Maybe he was greeting for it and he thought he could use it later versus MF? Let's get our boy Drake, Drake or Senn in here. The bush vision is fucking my shit up so fucking hard, dude.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,10290,Ugh. A flash auto Q would kill me. No one's in there, right? Oh, fuck. That back timing was really bad on me. Wow, that leash. Imagine starting this game off... Did they start off 3-0? Imagine thinking I would care about your shit ass fucking ult.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,10421,Fuck. No go. you you you you you you you you you you you you you hey i just want to say goodbye goodbye to the people who hated on me goodbye to the people who loved me goodbye to the people who trusted me goodbye goodbye to everybody
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,10832,goodbye to the people who hated on me goodbye to the people who loved me goodbye to the people who trusted me goodbye goodbye to everybody now i need some changes in my life now i need to move on in life now it's time to say goodbye goodbye goodbye to everybody

FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,10962,He killed him! I can't! I can't do this!
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,11016,Okay.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,11286,Um, thanks. Remember when people unironically thought this was a good song? I know you're tired of loving, of loving with nobody to love. Nobody, nobody. So just grab somebody. Don't leave at this party with nobody to love. Nobody, nobody.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,11365,Uh-huh, honey. All the mother niggas lame and you know it now. When a real nigga hold you down, you supposed to drown. BAM. BAM. Uh-huh, honey. What you doing in the club on a Thursday? She says she only here for a girl birthday.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,11390,They order champagne but still look thirsty. Rock forever 21 but just turn 30. I know I got a bad reputation. Walk around always mad reputation. Okay. Oh, wait. What are the comments on this? Wait, what happened to this post?
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,11423,Why is everything downloading? You're gaining experience. Could you connect the dots for botched caucus equals systemic bias against Bernie? I'd appreciate it. The new story this guy links was Mr. Price quit because he was friends with a lot of
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,11503,the people that ran a lot of the stuff. That's the evidence. So if you want actually a similar thing of this and they're like, oh, well, they fired him. This is actually similar to when Mueller fired Peter Strzok and the Republicans couldn't
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,11521,understand this. So Mueller fired you because you were biased in your investigation against Trump and you rigged it against him. And Strzok repeatedly said, no, he didn't fire me because of any impropriety. He fired me because it looked because of the appearance or because of the perception of
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,11538,impropriety because of the leaked texts. Not because any impropriety had actually occurred, but just because it looks like it could. That's how it would look. It looks bad, which is why he fired him. There's not a single instance of misdoing here.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,11552,It's just all a bunch of people that are all like, I'm sorry if this is like really like a huge shock to a lot of you guys. But like a lot of the people that work in these political campaigns probably know each
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,11562,other and probably have worked with each other in prior things. A lot of the people in the Bernie camp, a lot of the people in the Hillary Obama and every fucking mainstream, a lot of those people probably come from other political backgrounds.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,11574,Probably used to work with another guy used to be in another campaign used to. That's just how it works. When you're in this industry, you don't just pull people from the outside over and over and over again to do work like.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,11611,Destinies is the current campaign manager for Bernie Sanders. So Fay, Fay, Fay's Shakir is the campaign manager for us. Senator Bernie Sanders, 2020 presidential campaign before joining Sanders campaign. Shakir was the national political director for the ACLU. He also served as an advisor to Nancy Pelosi and Senator Harry Reid and was vice president
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,11645,of the Center for American Progress. He began his political career as a junior research staffer, John Kerry. And he worked as a vice president of communications at the Center for American Progress. I guarantee you that if I dig into the Center for American Progress, I could probably find
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,11657,a bunch of like links to other like Democrats as well. Like and this isn't Bernie Sanders campaign. Like I'm sure in every single fucking campaign, who's Jeff Weaver? I mean, we could probably look up like the political backgrounds of almost all these
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,11670,guys is probably going to come from like a lot of other like generally a lot of other people. Oh, this guy looks like he's a Vermont native and he's worked with Sanders for like 10 years. And Doris Sanders after Bernie dropped out.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,11698,None of these guys get articles. It's pretty common that like a lot of people in these political circles like borrow from like past political work like. Okay, wait, you know, doesn't he? You should debate that. Oh my god.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,11720,Wait, you want to know something really cute? This is behind the scenes. Destiny. No. Record a video for him saying, oh, this is dumb. And destiny like immediately was like, what's his name? And what is he like? And then he's like, I'm bored.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,11763,Listen to my song I made a few years back. I'll think about it. Use your brain a little. Did declaring to beat at 62% when Bernie was beating him in the popular vote they bought the same delegates was an error that went against Bernie.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,11778,Like I mean, like they didn't they declare Bernie was the winner with 80% in now it's 80% versus 62% you need to lead. I don't know dude. The conspiracy mongering is so fucking boring. Don't worry, he's hoping no one notices.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,11805,Wait, what are we hoping? D polar. Let me close the page after that I was connected as I thought they would be Pepe laugh. I'm looking it up live. The guy's campaign manager was connected. The second one wasn't.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,11816,I don't know. We could go through every single person like like that one campaign manager alone. That connection for you guys would be enough to like cast everything into doubt if that wasn't Bernie's campaign manager. Like what the fuck?
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,11827,How fucking stupid are you? This is why people don't like read anything live on stream. Well most of the dipshits you guys follow probably don't read anything at all period but see ya.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,11895,You live or this is an old stream VOD? Good one. Is this live right now? Dude, how many autos did you just do? How many autos did I just cancel? What the fuck? Was my attack speed slowed by something?
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,11943,I feel like I canceled two or three autos there. Does MFE slow? I don't think it slows attack speed. No way. Is this true? It's cheating. Yeeshu.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,12045,No! Oh, eh. God, I wish there was a build that used Doran's Blade and Doran's Shield so you'd have like a sword and shield or whatever.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,12184,I wish there was a build that used Doran's Blade and Doran's Shield. Need to be up swords so badly. Oh, I thought she was six. Even if she was I could have waited to see the laser. Estus howdy.
FxK_6YPnaEg,20200214,12282,Swain, you've been missing a lot of spells my dude. What a waste of time not the ult. Do you know any other languages outside of English? Uh, nope. Can you tell the difference Just like our Richard Hey, what's up?
