0.0, Well, well, well.
30.0, You're going to the gym with Malina?
55.0, I did my two gym days. I'm done. Tomorrow is our next one. But hopefully I wake up early, so I don't start my
60.0, stream at like 4 p.m.
69.0, Do you think, do you guys think Mooten's sleeping?
73.0, Oh my god, he's still here. He's a warrior.
77.0, Whoa, whoa, whoa.
82.0, There is some wacky stuff going on.
89.0, There's some wacky stuff, but I feel like overall is a good session.
96.0, I think that the initial wyvern stuff was just hard to push fast, but I'm glad we did.
103.0, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get a
108.86, bit ridiculous. The only reason I didn't is because I didn't know if we'd have to lower things later, but like it was so stupid.
116.0, Like our characters are literal brainlets. Like, okay, Tyriel, you go over there.
121.0, Oh, fire.
122.0, And then the other, like the night comes swinging her sword wildly into the hallway until she runs into me.
128.0, I'm not sure.
135.0, Oh, my god.
142.0, Just...
146.0, Wackster's going to whack, you know?
148.0, But we got out of there. We got out of the wagginess, and we're fucking rich now.
152.0, No, yes, we are rich, but more importantly.
154.0, Oh, mega rich. More importantly. We're fucking heroes.
158.0, Absolutely.
159.0, We're...
160.0, A portal got opened in the middle of the town.
163.0, You guys moonwalk the fuck out with 50-
166.0, With 50 nobles.
167.0, Yeah.
168.0, A direct fucking IV line to their goddamn mithrom.
171.0, Yep.
172.0, And, uh, yeah, Anton's going to talk some shit to that cleric.
176.0, Remember the cleric? He said you didn't do any good for anybody else but yourselves.
179.0, Well, here it is.
180.0, How many nights is she afraid?
183.0, Oh, my god.
192.0, Next bar I go to, I'm going to tell them how I'm going to level 99 cleric.
195.0, Tell them about my last D&D session.
205.0, Sorry, I'm updating my title, guys. Okay.
207.0, We're talking to Lauren at some point tonight.
210.0, Queen. The Nazi Queen.
214.0, Hello, and welcome to Runkel of the Bay.
217.0, 34 minutes, my dude.
219.0, My name is Ian Runkel, I'm a Canadian criminal offensive firearms lawyer.
222.0, They want to talk about the Alec Baldwin shooting.
224.0, So if you're not familiar with what happened here, Alec Baldwin was handling a firearm on a movie set.
226.0, Like, you're coming from your den. Yeah, Anton wants to die with some of these.
229.0, When we talk about firearm safety practices, any particular firearm safety practices on movie studios,
231.0, and how those differ from the firearm safety practices that you might follow at home or at the range.
234.0, Movies need to do different things with their guns than you'd be doing at the range.
236.0, And so the standard safety rules from, in terms of what you do at the range,
239.0, are both too strict and not strict enough in different ways.
241.0, There's different requirements.
242.0, So I'm going to be discussing that and the steps that are taken in order to make movie filming with firearms safe
245.0, and how things seem to have gone wrong.
246.0, I'm also going to be talking about Canadian law.
248.0, So I'll be discussing what charges I might see flowing from this if this were to happen here in Canada.
251.0, One thing I'm not going to be doing in a whole lot of detail is going on about Alec Baldwin's previous comments.
254.0, Yes, he has said some obnoxious things online and a lot of people don't like it.
256.0, But I don't think that's terribly relevant to the discussion here,
258.0, except that I will take this opportunity to remind people that if you're ever in a situation where there is some tragedy,
261.0, either an accident or that you're forced to use a weapon to defend yourself,
263.0, your comments that you make on social media may be analyzed by the public, by the police, by prosecutors and potentially by a jury.
269.0, So if you're in a habit of saying things that you might regret later,
271.0, now's a good time to get out of that habit.
272.0, I'm sure that some of the comments that have been told and have been made in the past are things that now he wishes he'd never set.
275.0, So the next thing I want to do is talk about the reports, what has been reported and so what things I will be assuming are true for the purposes of talking about this.
280.0, I don't know personally what went down, I wasn't there, the investigation is fully complete.
283.0, But there's a lot of things that have been reported and so I'll sort of be relying on those in terms of making my assessments here.
286.0, The first thing is that apparently this has been a movie set that's been plagued with problems, including safety complaints.
289.0, And one of the things that's been reported is that there were two situations previously where a gun that was supposed to be cold, so nothing in it could fire, no blanks, nothing went bang when the figure was pulled.
296.0, Twice prior was the reports.
297.0, So that's a very concerning thing and very relevant I think to further analysis.
300.0, The next thing is that apparently Baldwin was handed a firearm and was told it was a cold gun.
303.0, Now people have been unclear on what cold gun means, so I'll just try to make this very clear.
306.0, A cold gun should be one that has nothing in it that goes bang.
308.0, No light ammunition in the conventional sense of something that is started to projectile, nor anything nor any blanks.
312.0, So it should be a firearm where if you pull the trigger, all you're going to hear is click.
315.0, That's very important.
316.0, And we are told that Baldwin was at this point, they weren't filming a scene, but he was practicing.
319.0, Oh, I don't think this piece of information was released from this video went out, but there was an...
323.0, It might have been an AP story today.
326.0, So apparently dummy rounds are...
330.0, Remember we drew our big dick thing?
333.0, So apparently a dummy round has a projectile on it, but there's a small hole in the side of the cartridge where you'd have gunpowder, and that's how you know it's a dummy round.
345.0, So we pull the trigger, nothing happens.
347.0, And apparently three of the four rounds that were in the revolver were these dummy rounds, but the fourth one was not.
355.0, The fourth one was a real actual live projectile cartridge, like, yeah, gikes.
364.0, Drawing.
365.0, So he was drawing the firearm, practicing a cross draw, and it's not entirely clear how this went off.
368.0, This is a Western period firearm, and from the sounds of it probably a handgun revolver.
372.0, Some of the firearms from that era had problems where, for instance, an exposed hammer could get caught and it could fire.
375.0, They have less safety features than modern firearms.
377.0, So it's not clear if Baldwin pulled the trigger, or if perhaps it snagged on his costume and ended up firing in that direction, or in that fashion.
382.0, So we don't entirely know how it fired, but it does appear that he was practicing sort of firearm handling as opposed to, in the course of filming.
387.0, So this is not a situation where, for instance, some people have theorized that he might be pointing the gun at the camera for a particular stage shot.
391.0, It doesn't appear from the current records that that's the case, and this is also relevant in terms of our analysis and our assessment here.
395.0, It also seems, and this is a bit of an inference on my part, that this was live conventional projectile firing ammunition.
399.0, And I say that because although blanks are dangerous, blanks are not perfectly safe for a gun.
404.0, When you fire a blank, there is a projectile. It's just a bit of wax or paper or something else that is less harmful, and it's coming out at less speed, but that's required in order to make the blank function properly.
410.0, That can injure or kill somebody at short ranges.
412.0, So people have been injured or killed by playing around with blanks.
414.0, One thing that's happened on occasion is people have put it under their head, it's loaded with blanks, and they think that's going to be harmless.
418.0, And both the hot gases that are projected and a little projectile end up killing them or injuring them quite badly.
422.0, So this is a, you know, one thing to consider, but I don't think that this was a blank.
425.0, The reason why is that the reports that we're seeing at the moment say that there was one shot fired and that it penetrated through the director and then into the cinematographer.
430.0, I don't think that the paper or plastic or wax wad from a blank would be likely to over penetrate that factor.
434.0, Wait, hold on, I'm sorry, real quick, because I hope it says.
436.0, When I said that one of the rounds appeared to be a live run and the other three times, I'm not trying to give the impression that like it was a sabotage to murder somebody.
443.0, I don't think that happened.
444.0, I'm just saying that's what that's what was reported inside the firearm.
447.0, This was a situation where a live cartridge somehow found its way on the set.
450.0, I should note here, in terms of set safety, live cartridges should never be on a firearm using set.
454.0, With one exception that does not apply here.
456.0, That exception is if you're filming something, for instance, a documentary where you're looking at ballistics.
459.0, If you're looking at firing a real gun into ballistic gelatin or something, then you might need in a very specific circumstance to have live cartridges on set.
464.0, But that doesn't apply here.
466.0, And if that is happening, they take very, very, very special precautions to make sure.
469.0, One of the critical safety procedures for filming is that live cartridges are nowhere on set and never make it into the gun.
474.0, So that is a critical, this is one of those facts that in and of itself, if it turns out to be true, essentially tells us that something went catastrophically wrong in terms of the safety procedures.
481.0, Some of the reports we've been hearing as well, and I can't confirm them at this stage because this is all reports.
484.0, But are the people who are playing around with these things during off hours, taking them out to the range and shooting live for themselves?
488.0, For so many people in that mind?
490.0, Yeah, my brain, in terms of strategy, was thinking like we could just...
495.0, The castle is going to be the hardest.
497.0, Run through, absolutely.
498.0, That's your keep.
500.0, Like, why would you have all the defense buried in the mind?
503.0, I almost didn't drink potions after we killed all the first people.
506.0, It was like, there's no way anybody else would do it.
508.0, You bring them all to the front.
509.0, If you were going to be able to be all fighting, why would you have more people deep in?
512.0, But I drank it just because I was like, this is a wacky episode, so I'm glad I did.
515.0, True, yeah, you definitely needed to.
535.0, Gordon.
536.0, Who the fuck asked?
542.0, How could the hell hounds light up in the darkness?
544.0, That was what I thought was the wacky as well, but you know what, dude?
552.0, Nice dude.
558.0, Man, we're still going, huh?
560.0, Ooh, the wackster!
563.0, Oh my god! You're wacking it, dude.
567.0, Okay, cool.
568.0, A little wacky, but, you know.
571.0, Oh my god.
573.0, I have it in three.
581.0, I got ignited.
583.0, I'm not there.
584.0, I'm going to die.
586.0, That's a freak kill.
587.0, There's no summoners.
590.0, Fuck.
591.0, Okay.
595.0, Oh, does she need home?
596.0, Yes, I don't know.
601.0, Oh, dude, you would have been inting hard.
603.0, I would have.
611.0, It's not going to kill.
613.0, This game's fucked.
615.0, We had a huge lane advantage, and now we're like, no lane advantage.
617.0, I fucked it up.
619.0, We both fucked it up.
620.0, Well, no, I didn't.
621.0, I did everything well.
622.0, I blew something on this one.
624.0, I fucked her.
625.0, I got these guys all fucked up.
626.0, I don't know what it is.
627.0, He is no flash.
628.0, He is no ignite.
629.0, We saw a summon advantage.
630.0, I have ignite still.
634.0, Well, wait, what do you mean we have a summon advantage?
636.0, I have ignite.
637.0, Do you think they used heal?
641.0, Didn't she flash?
642.0, Yeah, but I flashed too.
644.0, So where's our advantage?
645.0, I have...
646.0, Okay, you have this, and I have this.
648.0, He has no ignite.
650.0, Thank you for playing a one summon.
651.0, Why did he ignite?
652.0, I don't know, but he ignited me.
654.0, I just fucked.
655.0, It's MF.
656.0, We have to play everything back.
658.0, Yeah, we're going to play like cocks.
659.0, I need level two or whatever.
663.0, Destiny Gus Johnson, please God, I've been waiting all day.
666.0, I will have done it today.
672.0, We should go back here.
675.0, Wait, should we?
676.0, I could say, I'm just worried about your health.
679.0, I canceled my bag.
680.0, You're a dumbfock.
681.0, Now you're fucking my back coming up.
683.0, Dumbfock.
686.0, You need to wait anyways.
702.0, There's hellhounds with the scariest fucking thing in that mine.
704.0, The guaranteed seven damage.
706.0, Yeah, it's a crazy animal.
712.0, I'm not going to pick this because it's going to push towards us anyway.
715.0, They're going to have level three before us.
717.0, I got back.
718.0, Back.
719.0, Back.
720.0, Who's there, generally?
721.0, Echo.
725.0, Echo.
726.0, I got back.
727.0, I got back.
728.0, I got back.
729.0, I got back.
730.0, I got back.
731.0, I got back.
734.0, They have a blood on their team, by the way.
736.0, Cool.
737.0, Just telling fuck you right now.
739.0, I'm just saying it's a fuck you.
740.0, I just did.
741.0, Just hold it to their stuff.
742.0, We'll head.
752.0, I can't come up.
753.0, Not cool.
754.0, I have to jump away.
755.0, I might already be done.
756.0, I'm going to go over that.
761.0, Back.
762.0, What?
763.0, Back up.
771.0, I got back up.
772.0, I'm dead.
776.0, That tower dive?
778.0, That was the worst play in the world.
779.0, I wasn't even ready for it.
780.0, We're fucked.
781.0, We just lost all the experience.
783.0, We're fucked.
788.0, My mind is actually blown from the dark.
792.0, I can't believe it.
793.0, I actually can't even believe she flashed over for that.
794.0, It was actually so bad.
795.0, I wasn't even ready for it.
800.0, Okay.
805.0, We're two fucking levels down.
808.0, We're done for the rest of the fucking game.
810.0, I hope that the rest of our team carries.
812.0, We have this dog shit fucking player on our team too.
815.0, Every single time on our team, they fucking feed.
818.0, Okay.
825.0, Hey, guys.
828.0, One melee on the...
836.0, Oh, yeah.
843.0, Do you want me to hit him as soon as possible?
845.0, Yeah, this is pushing anyway.
846.0, We're going to fucking end faster, so just give me the fuck to the fountain.
850.0, Give me out!
860.0, Can you pull out Drake?
862.0, Yeah, okay.
869.0, Seriously?
877.0, This guy really just fucking jumped in.
879.0, Like a fucking brainlet there, shit.
888.0, Holy shit.
889.0, Oh, it's like a top lamp.
892.0, We have no priority on that, yeah.
895.0, Let's get this party started.
916.0, Really, dude?
923.0, Where the hell did you get?
941.0, I'm playing a lot of X, but then she's supposed to win lane.
943.0, Every single X who's gotten on our team has not only lost lane, they fed fucking hard.
947.0, Oh, we have X?
948.0, Yes, every single time.
949.0, I hear this champ is supposed to be good, but every single time has been on our team, it's just fed fucking hard.
952.0, Or lost lane hard, it's fucking irritating us to fuck.
960.0, Back up, if I die, I'm going to return.
961.0, I'm going to end the rest of the game.
962.0, I'm going to run it down harder than you've ever seen me run it down before.
965.0, I'm just telling him, actually not joking.
966.0, I'm just going to just right click down to the Nexus for the rest of the game.
969.0, I don't believe you did that.
970.0, Okay, we'll see.
971.0, All right, you can try it.
974.0, Destiny, Nebraska's D 2021 slash 2022.
978.0, I got it.
983.6, We played like this.
984.6, We would get punished, especially with Emma.
988.0, But, okay, all right, I can die now.
991.0, I won't end.
992.0, Or at least not intentionally.
998.0, If she comes on her turret, you can go for it.
1003.0, Nice.
1004.0, Because I'm putting a hard burst pen.
1007.0, They're waiting 1 million trillion percent.
1012.0, They can't be.
1017.0, Okay, here.
1019.0, No, wait, she's all.
1025.0, Can you take a couple shots on this for me?
1032.0, I'll fire you from six.
1038.0, Okay, run away, run away.
1044.0, If that reset, you'd have fucking lost it.
1050.0, You can solo so that if you want, we can meme out.
1057.0, You think you can bait.
1068.0, I don't know.
1078.0, Nice.
1079.0, Just got to the turn and observe the exp.
1086.0, I got it.
1098.0, It's twice my CS.
1105.0, I got all that CS.
1112.0, I got it.
1118.0, I got it.
1123.0, I got it.
1127.0, I got it.
1132.0, I got it.
1145.0, Why is there four?

1220.0, I got it.
1232.0, I got it.
1237.0, She already has her item finished.
1243.0, I'll never win one of these votes.
1249.0, I got it.
1254.0, I got it.
1259.0, I got it.

1335.0, I talked to him.
1340.0, I can't wait to go on vacation.
1345.0, I got it.
1352.0, I can't wait to go on vacation.
1357.0, I'm able to play this fucking game.
1362.0, Absolutely true.
1367.0, I need to make this through the first explosion.
1372.0, The band will go on another chance.
1379.0, Why does this game even do?
1384.0, He doesn't have anything.
1389.0, I just need to play the right direction.
1413.0, He's just a loser.
1423.0, I might as well myself.
1428.0, We're just listening.
1433.0, I'm going over that.
1448.0, He's on the boil.

1905.0, They're trapped in your boss.
1925.0, Don't worry.
1929.0, Once somebody gets a pentacle here, everybody's spirits are going to turn.
1933.0, It's going to be based.

2433.0, I'm going over that.
2453.0, I'm going over that.
2473.0, I'm going over that.
2493.0, I'm going over that.
2513.0, I'm going over that.
2533.0, I'm going over that.
2553.0, I'm going over that.
2573.0, I'm going over that.
2593.0, I'm going over that.
2613.0, I'm going over that.
2633.0, I'm going over that.
2653.0, I'm going over that.
2673.0, I'm going over that.
2693.0, I'm going over that.
2713.0, I'm going over that.
2733.0, I'm going over that.
2753.0, I'm going over that.
2773.0, I'm going over that.
2793.0, I'm going over that.
2813.0, I'm going over that.
2813.0, I'm going over that.
2817.0, Does the armor potentially face liability?
2818.44, Well, quite possibly.
2819.6, If it's the case that the armor allowed
2820.8, to lie cartridges, like projectile firing cartridges,
2822.24, on set, that is a potential ground score of carolissness.
2824.68, If it's the case that the armor used these firearms
2826.24, or allowed them to use percargic rectus
2827.76, and failed to properly clear them,
2829.2, that's another place where we might find
2830.16, careless use of a firearm.
2831.32, Careless storage of a firearm was the assistant director
2832.72, who said to have retrieved this firearm.
2834.0, Was he supposed to have access to that?
2834.92, Was that something that was supposed to happen?
2835.92, Or did that result from some sort of negligence
2837.42, or force of supervision on the part of the armor?
2839.28, Because if that's the case, and if that then results
2840.72, in the death, then you may have a situation
2842.0, where manslaughter is a potential charge.
2843.44, And that would be a really bad circumstance here
2844.8, because ultimately that's where you start seeing some really
2846.8, big jail time potentials.
2847.8, Again, this is if it were in Canada,
2848.6400000000003, I'm not going to be able to contemplate it.
2849.48, 22 CS.
2850.32, I consider it a US law because I'm not a US lawyer.
2851.7200000000003, You don't need more ignorant takes on this.
2853.04, As long as you're getting the levels,
2853.88, that's not really matters on your top-liner.
2855.88, What about the assistant director?
2856.7200000000003, Well, again, this is a situation where it might be careless use.
2858.6400000000003, When he says cold fire is, you know, that it's a cold gun.
2861.44, Did he check that?
2862.28, Or did he just assume that it's a cold gun
2863.28, because it's on that counter?
2864.2000000000003, The assistant director is one of the people
2865.48, who's responsible for safety.
2866.4, If he doesn't know that this is a cold gun,
2867.88, or if he hasn't taken proper precautions,
2869.36, then this may be a situation where there's nothing I can do.
2875.6400000000003, That was a very short story.
2876.6400000000003, That was in the course of filming.
2877.6400000000003, And so if it was in the course of filming,
2878.6400000000003, then this is going to be a very short story.
2879.6400000000003, There it goes.
2880.6400000000003, I'm at an F-D-R-H-P again.
2881.6400000000003, You know, a situation where they say back to the tower.
2882.6400000000003, Back to the tower.
2883.6400000000003, It is safe to do so.
2884.6400000000003, It is safe to hold a printer at this stage.
2885.6400000000003, Those kinds of things.
2886.6400000000003, And it's not usually the actors' responsibility
2888.28, to check the firearm.
2889.28, Although, properly speaking, they should be checking
2890.28, if they should be insisting that the armor shows them
2892.28, that it's a safe gun before they take on that responsibility.
2894.28, And, you know, right now, as it stands,
2895.28, the talent, you know, the actors aren't really expected
2897.28, to have any firearm proficiency, but I think that's something
2899.28, that maybe should change.
2900.28, Maybe it should be that if you want to be an actor who handles
2902.28, firearms on set and who does this sort of thing,
2904.28, that you have to take some courses and get some proficiency,
2906.28, especially in firearms safety, that you are also part of the safety
2908.28, suit.
2909.28, But, you know, let's consider the question of what was Baldwin
2911.28, doing with his gun, because if he's relying on, you know,
2913.28, instructions, hey, this is a full gun.
2914.28, That still doesn't necessarily give him a bill or the permission.
2916.28, I don't even know what the circle around is.
2918.28, There's a problem.
2919.28, Because if you're not in film, it's just for practice,
2921.28, then you're not allowed to find a firearm here in Canada
2923.28, at anyone without a lawful excuse.
2924.28, So, you know, it's a very careful way to go, but simply practicing it,
2927.28, or you don't need it again.
2928.28, I think that that's a much more difficult sell for not being
2930.28, a lawful excuse.
2931.28, I think that's a place where he could potentially face charges
2932.28, for the pointing of firearm.
2933.28, And once that is potentially on the table, then it might open
2935.28, the door to, again, the big price, the manslaughter charge.
2937.28, So, that's one concern.
2938.28, The other thing is that Mr. Baldwin was apparently a producer.
2940.28, Now, there's been some debate as to whether he might get
2942.28, producer in the sense of actually having control, or whether
2944.28, this is sort of a nominal producer shift, just so that he can get
2946.28, proper, you know, just as part of sort of the Byzantine ways
2948.28, that Hollywood pays people.
2949.28, So, but regardless, we've heard that there were two accidental
2952.28, discharges here, or not accidental, negligent discharges would be
2954.28, the proper terminology here, because there were situations
2956.28, where it was supposed to be a cold gun and was not.
2958.28, That also raises the question of what should these people
2960.28, have done knowing that?
2961.28, You know, should there have been a shutdown here?
2962.28, And I'm going to say, yeah, there should have.
2963.28, In order to reassess things.
2964.28, I mean, if you have one, you know, negligent discharge on a set,
2966.28, I think that everybody would want to say, let's stop, let's do
2968.28, a big takedown and figure out what went wrong.
2970.28, This is a big problem.
2971.28, That's one.
2972.28, At two, I'd be expecting them to shut things down and start
2973.28, firing people.
2974.28, Because, you know, once is, okay, maybe somebody screwed up.
2976.28, Two is, there is a powder here, and somebody might die.
2978.28, In fact, it's ultimately something did.
2982.28, So, that's, you know, also raises questions.
2983.28, What should be considered given those situations?
2984.28, Frankly, we're still waiting to see what comes out.
2986.28, I don't know what charges will or will not be laid here.
2988.28, But here in Canada, there would definitely, I think, be a path
2990.28, to lay charges against at least one person, or up to manslaughter.
2992.28, This is an ugly situation.
2994.28, But the next question we start to get to is, what should be done?
2996.28, And really, there's people apparently in the US saying, we need to
2999.28, be in the US.
3000.28, Me to, me to.
3001.28, I don't think that's called for here.
3002.28, The safety record is not that.
3003.28, And the issue here isn't the real fire used on the set.
3004.28, It's carelessness.
3005.28, It's not following safety.
3006.28, That's what appears to be the situation here.
3007.28, It appears that various rules that are essential for ensuring
3010.28, the firearms are safely used on set were not properly followed.
3012.28, And that's my concern here.
3013.28, And when we have this tragedy, there's this rush to do something.
3015.28, Everyone wants to be seen to be the solution.
3017.28, And sometimes the solution is not what it looks like.
3019.28, There's not the situation to ban firearms being used on set.
3021.28, But perhaps to look at, you know, labour rules, look at, you know,
3023.28, whether there was proper supervision here.
3024.28, Certainly one response here that I think is entirely appropriate
3026.28, is that there's going to be lawsuits and there's going to be a lot
3028.28, of, you know, sorting things out in terms of, you know, there's
3032.28, going to be a lot of, a lot of money that's going to end up changing
3034.28, hands, I suspect, over this one.
3035.28, There's going to be people getting sued and it's going to be ugly.
3037.28, But I don't want to get this really good step in.
3039.28, No, no!
3040.28, It needs to be a call for a record.
3042.28, Oh, I'm sorry.
3043.28, Because there's lots of armors who have lengthy, you know,
3045.28, and no safety issues.
3046.28, This really illustrates, you know, how important that is to have
3048.28, a skilled and trained and, you know, proficient armor on set.
3051.28, And, you know, peak in control.
3052.28, So I guess those are sort of my thoughts here.
3054.28, I probably left some stuff out.
3055.28, This is a bit of a complicated and convoluted video.
3057.28, I don't want it to get too long.
3058.28, But let me know if you think, let me know if you think I've missed anything.
3059.28, Or if you think I'm out to lunch, I really wanted to sort of share some of the comments here
3062.28, and some of the details of what's going on here.
3065.28, Because I was seeing things like prop gun being used for cold versus live and what that means.
3067.28, And I think a lot of the commentary out there was not really considering the issue.
3070.28, And not really spending the time to try to understand it.
3072.28, I hope I've made this clearer.
3073.28, I hope I've added to the discussion.
3074.28, I'm sure that if I haven't, I'm going to get some emails from some of the people I spoke with.
3076.28, Hey, one call with a help.
3077.28, And if I do, if I screw this up, I will do a follow-up video.
3079.28, Don't pay, here's what I screwed up.
3080.28, But it's a pretty short.
3081.28, I just wanted to share this with you.
3082.28, It's a, it's a venting thing.
3083.28, It's pretty short.
3084.28, And I think that we're looking in some of the wrong places here in terms of what's going on.
3092.28, Anyway, thank you for watching.
3093.28, I wanted to thank my Patreon supporters at the $50 level, John and the $10,000 association.
3096.28, It's like we left a center of the Nature High Global Firearms Association.
3098.28, Mike, John, you can thank CCR and Canadian Chainlet Association.
3100.28, At the $30 level, Sykes and Arm's Limited, and Mark with the AT&O.
3102.28, And at the $20 level, Raymond, Arm's
3107.2000000000003, Chainlet, Cameron, John, and Drew Elsich, and Aaron Gelsalt.
3108.28, Again, thank you as well to who the armors move to, why does a lot of information need to help me better understand what's going on?
3112.28, I'm not sure.
3114.28, My great video.
3116.28, How's your game going, man?
3118.28, Yeah.
3119.28, I'm losing.
3120.28, But you, you can lose.
3122.28, Just don't lose it.
3123.28, I'm having fun, yeah.
3124.28, As long as you don't lose it, we're good.
3126.28, Yeah.
3127.28, Just cast your snare.
3142.28, No, I'm going to slow it, but whatever.
3147.28, Okay, this kinder does not do anything.
3163.28, The email fold, don't die.
3167.28, Is this fucking water?
3173.28, Okay, good one, dude.
3180.28, Cool, and we're dead.
3185.28, 100% dead.
3186.28, No counterplay.
3187.28, This is really good.
3194.28, Seven and one talent.
3201.28, I don't know why I played this.
3208.28, I knew it.
3209.28, I just hate myself.
3210.28, Once we get rolling, these kids don't have a chance.
3216.28, I just hate myself.
3230.28, I don't think they even have a chance.
3249.28, We got a great team fight.
3252.28, Galileo Amumu ult.
3253.28, Is that even beatable?
3254.28, Did they even have a chance?
3255.28, I don't think they even have a chance.
3265.28, We got a good skill, too.
3272.28, I'll take it.
3289.28, I can't believe it.
3309.28, I can't do anything, dude.
3327.28, I can't do anything.
3344.28, It's a circle of life.
3349.28, It moves us all.
3368.28, Are you actually serious?
3372.28, Oh, yeah, we're super serious.
3382.28, Just the five, man.
3387.28, All of a sudden, where is it?
3407.28, Okay, okay.
3410.28, If you're gonna leave a girl for dead, I'll least buy her dinner first.
3423.28, Yeah, these guys are underestimating the late game mood, okay?
3432.28, Have they let you farm?
3434.28, They're gonna be unstoppable.
3437.28, I'm gonna be...
3438.28, I'm making a big mistake by underestimating the room.
3445.28, I'm gonna be a little bit more
3461.28, I won't die then, and I won't die now.
3464.28, I'm gonna be a circle.
3494.28, I just have no follow-up, you know?
3499.28, Nobody's there. Nobody's with me, dude.
3511.28, Hehehe, gave me that cannon minion, yes.
3517.28, I took her even though, don't worry, dude.
3519.28, I handled her.
3520.28, I smack her down.
3521.28, Well, no, Jesus, no, I just thought I didn't die to her, you know?
3524.28, Okay, good, good, good.
3533.28, Great build, yes, I'm almost on my... Oh, I just got my first item. Big!
3538.28, You wanna run it down bot?
3540.28, I'm running, dude.
3542.28, About 61, dude. Oh shit.
3544.28, He's gone.
3551.28, And oh! The shame!
3558.28, I have faster moves with them. I got them.
3560.28, Oh, cool.
3568.28, Just die.
3570.28, No, all five.
3572.28, Okay, cool.
3577.28, Did you vote? Yes?
3579.28, Absolutely. I have long ago lost my fucking mind.
3587.28, Alright, well, fun, good two games, have fun.
3594.28, No leak for a week, guys. What are we gonna do?
3596.28, Fuck.
3626.28, Oh.
3642.28, Okay, I got a lot of shit to lunch.
3646.28, Where's fucking Lauren? What time are we doing this?
3668.28, Here's where you take on Ghost Johnson. I don't have to take on Ghost Johnson because we haven't watched the video yet.
3672.28, We're watching it tonight. It's in the...
3675.28, Well, it's in the roster, whatever you'd say.
3682.28, Shut the fuck up, moving, alright? It's a stupid fucking meme.
3686.28, Hurry up, Lauren. I wanna start a video.
3689.28, It'll be back on second.
3691.28, When are we doing this tonight?
3696.28, Where the fuck is Lauren at?
3706.28, Wife turning her husband into Sissy Princess Peach cosplay.
3710.28, What? Okay, I think we're gonna...
3728.28, Chat rated this clipping nine.
3731.28, Oh, man.
3733.28, Herbine.
3740.28, It's like the 17th iteration of that turbine that don't work.
3745.28, I do like that there's no wing, there's just the turbine. That's important.
3750.28, Oh my God.
3752.28, I really like the idea of a sullie movie that opens with the bird hitting the planet sequence.
3759.28, Not bad.
3764.28, No, no, no!
3769.28, Oh my God.
3778.28, Why would there be more like investigations?
3783.28, It's already in trial.
3785.28, Why not just wait until the trial finishes? What's the point of going over?
3790.28, I can't watch it.
3795.28, I made timestamps to watch out for you so you don't get banned.
3800.28, You're giving me a video to watch with four timestamps that could get me banned.
3805.28, I think I'm gonna be doing it.
3810.28, I'm gonna be doing it.
3815.28, I'm gonna be doing it.
3819.28, I'm gonna be doing it.
3824.28, I'm gonna be doing it.
3829.28, What is the point of going over the tracks?
3834.28, I'm gonna be doing it.
3837.28, I'm gonna be doing it.
3842.28, I'm gonna be doing it.
3847.28, I'm Destiny, first time donating. My friend Bibi loves her stream, but she is feeling sick.
3852.28, Anything you can say to me could feel better. Thanks.
3857.28, I feel better, Bibi.
3867.28, I don't know what you are gonna say.
3876.28, Okay.
3887.28, Gus Johnson drama. That's what we're doing.
3890.28, Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
3895.28, Watch the 16 minute video of city police arresting an ATF agent.
3910.28, I have no problem making this.
3915.28, Free.
3916.28, When I got here, don't move for me.
3920.28, This is a pretty safe channel, right?
3923.28, I'll add it to the list of things.
3953.28, Okay.
3962.28, Good luck.
3968.28, Oh, hello.
3972.28, On this very day, a certain number of years ago, I was in the hospital dying.
3979.28, It was the worst experience of my entire life.
3984.28, Sounds accurate.
3987.28, I don't recommend it.
3991.28, 10 out of 10 don't recommend not even with rice.
3996.28, And I was alone for most of it.
3999.28, But little by little, as I did open up to some friends, I ended up finding that similar stuff like this happens.
4005.28, I was like, oh, I'm not sure what's going on.
4010.28, Let me just backtrack and show you guys how I got there.
4015.28, So years ago, I found out that I was pregnant.
4020.28, And I did not want to be.
4022.28, I was not ready for that.
4024.28, And as soon as I confirmed it at home, I made a doctor's appointment.
4029.28, Immediately, just to get a second confirmation and just find out where to go from there.
4035.28, I had Kaiser Permanente at the time.
4037.28, They suck.
4038.28, First of all, Kaiser, you suck.
4040.28, I'm so happy I'm not with you anymore.
4042.28, But even though we're in California, the blue estate probably in the whole country,
4047.28, you still have to go through quite a few hoops to terminate a pregnancy.
4052.28, And it's scary.
4053.28, And even at the first doctor's appointment, I think it didn't fully set.
4056.28, Okay, hold on, I have to get this following the first football at all.
4059.28, What do you think about Scott Frost?
4061.28, He sucked.
4062.28, Never lived up to Callahan, which is sad because even Callahan couldn't live up to Osborn Rip.
4065.28, Out to Planned Parenthood because Kaiser Permanente refused to do it, which is wild.
4072.28, So they referred me out to Planned Parenthood.
4074.28, I made the appointment there.
4076.28, I went and they couldn't see anything, which was weird.
4084.28, I was a little scared because I was certainly far enough along for something to be seen.
4092.28, Okay, sorry, hold on.
4093.28, It's a Planned Parenthood.
4095.28, Okay, Lauren said 930, Jesus.
4097.280000000001, To do it, which is wild.
4100.280000000001, So they referred me out to Planned Parenthood.
4102.280000000001, I made the appointment there.
4104.280000000001, I went and they couldn't see anything, which was weird.
4113.28, Because I was certainly far enough along for something to be seen.
4120.28, And they couldn't see anything.
4123.28, So they thought, well, maybe you're not as far along as we thought.
4127.28, Come back in two weeks or something, which, you know, when you're trying to not be pregnant anymore is not what you want to hear at all.
4137.28, Especially when most of the medical workers that you've been interacting with have been telling you things like, are you sure you want to do this?
4146.28, You have to be 100% sure.
4148.28, If you're even 99% sure, we're not going to let you do this.
4153.28, So it sticks with you a little bit.
4156.28, I always knew that I had to end it.
4159.28, But it's just harder when you're getting a lot of opposing pressure, pressure to not do it from medical staff.
4172.28, And honestly, you're on body.
4174.28, It's so weird.
4175.28, Like once you get those hormones in your body, there's like this instinct that kicks in that makes you want to protect it.
4181.28, Even though your brain is like, no, no, we're not ready for this.
4184.28, This was always the plan. If this happened, you promised your boyfriend that we would do this.
4189.28, So it was really scary to be receiving all this conflicting pressure from medical staff and your body to not do it and then being pressured by your partner to do it.
4199.28, It felt like I didn't even have a choice.
4202.28, It really felt like I wasn't even allowed to consider what would happen if I didn't.
4211.28, And I'm reiterating over and over. I mean, look at my appointments.
4215.28, This was always what I was going to do. I was constantly taking the steps to end the pregnancy.
4226.28, But it's really scary when somebody is forcing you to do it.
4236.28, And I did have moments of weakness where I would cry and say things like, okay, but honestly, can we just consider like, what if we didn't do it?
4244.28, Still going to do it, but can we just consider what would happen if I didn't?
4249.28, Oh my God, I'm sorry, but my sympathy meter is at zero right now.
4254.28, Holy shit. Sorry. Okay.
4258.28, Can you imagine you have a girlfriend and you've like agreed like, okay, like we use protection.
4262.28, We don't, whatever, but if you get pregnant, like we're going to have an abortion, right?
4266.28, It's like, yeah, of course. And then they get pregnant and they're like, okay, but what if we didn't get an abortion?
4271.28, It's like, hmm, Jesus Christ.
4276.28, This is my autism or social property, whatever you want to call this speaking.
4281.28, And I did have these deliberate choices to leave in the crying, like really trigger me.
4288.28, Like we have a full five seconds of silence here to like sell the crying point.
4293.28, I think this isn't a stream. This is a pre-recorded video. Like you can edit this or script this however you want.
4298.28, Really scary when somebody is forcing you to do it.
4305.28, Like.
4307.28, And I did have moments of weakness where I would cry and say things like, okay, but honestly, like, can we just consider like, what if we didn't do it?
4315.28, Still going to do it, but can we just consider what would happen if I didn't?
4322.28, And he would say like, no, it's not even a question. You're going to ruin my life if you do that.
4331.28, That would be the worst thing to ever happen to me.
4335.28, As along the lines of things that he would say. And at one point, he even said that he would break up the thing.
4341.28, If I didn't do it.
4343.28, I mean, oh, yeah, what do you, I mean, Jesus Christ.
4352.28, Okay, let's keep going.
4355.28, And that he would resent me and the potential child.
4363.28, And that's really stuck with me.
4369.28, Because then at that point, in mind you, I haven't told anybody, I think I told one single friend.
4379.28, Couldn't tell my family. I couldn't tell. I couldn't talk to anybody.
4384.28, I'm just really scary.
4391.28, And so at that point, it's like, well, if you're making threats like that,
4398.28, why should I?
4399.28, Threats!
4401.28, What?
4403.28, Okay, I beat the game, so.
4407.28, Consider you in this decision at all.
4409.28, And so-
4410.28, Oh my God, she is like the actual nightmare. She's like, she is the nightmare. Holy shit.
4417.28, Like, the scariest thing in the world is doing everything.
4420.28, I guess technically doing everything the most correct is making sure nobody ever gets pregnant.
4424.28, But imagine you're dating somebody and you have an agreement where it's like, okay, like if somebody gets pregnant,
4427.28, like we'll get an abortion, you know, we'll figure it out.
4429.28, And then when they get pregnant, they start getting you to second guess.
4433.28, Holy shit. That's like, that is like the actual fucking nightmare scenario to be trapped in.
4438.28, Because you're like, you have no control over the situation.
4441.28, You're completely and totally fucked. You're like, well, 18 years, like fuck me, you know, like you're completely fucked.
4447.28, Holy shit.
4449.28, Well, I did start to think a little bit more.
4453.28, Should I actually end it?
4456.28, And it's true. That was me reneging.
4459.28, Because I feel like when you start a relationship, you have the conversation of, hey, if you get pregnant,
4465.28, what's the plan? And of course it's so easy to say like, oh, yeah, absolutely. I'm not ready to be a parent yet.
4471.28, No, not anytime soon.
4473.28, God, it's so much scarier when it's happening to you in real life.
4478.28, So-
4479.28, Dude, the editing and the crying and looking up- Oh God, it actually hurts to watch this, but okay.
4485.28, It's really hard. And then I just kept having pain and bleeding.
4491.28, And nobody took me seriously. And then one morning, I woke up at about 4 a.m.
4499.28, To the most intense pain I've ever felt in my life, in my lower left abdomen.
4506.28, And it was so sharp and painful.
4509.28, And I went to the bathroom because all of a sudden I'm bleeding a lot, which can't be normal.
4515.28, And I couldn't even stand up because the pain was just so intense.
4519.28, Oh, yeah, ectopic. That's what it sounds like.
4521.28, If they didn't see it when they checked with the ultrasound and she's having a lot of pains.
4524.28, Sometimes when you fertilize an egg, I think it can get stuck in the fallopian tubes,
4529.28, which is considered an ectopic pregnancy, which can have- which will fuck you, which can fuck everything up really, really, really badly.
4534.28, Multiple times.
4536.28, And one other-
4538.28, Who is going to make a video like this and be objective enough to cut out all the crying emotional stuff?
4543.28, That's not gonna happen?
4545.28, Um...
4547.28, Ah...
4570.28, I prefer really not to speak.
4574.28, If I speak, I am in big trouble. In big trouble. And I don't want to be in big trouble.
4582.28, First time as I went, the lady was just like, well, just take some time at all.
4587.28, Go home. What do you want me to do?
4592.28, And then I went again later that day because I was still having so much pain.
4597.28, And they said, uh, oh, you're probably miscarrying. Go bleed it out at home.
4604.28, And then over the course of the next few days, you know, I'm just taking medicine to manage the pain, which is constant.
4613.28, And I'm still bleeding a lot. My appetite is weird.
4616.28, Even eating something as small as a grape caused so much pain. So I wasn't really eating.
4623.28, But my stomach was growing. A lot. For the span of a few days, my stomach probably expanded from here to here.
4632.28, Who the fuck are these doctors? They're literally negligent.
4635.28, If you have... I don't know if doctors just see a lot of people that fake pain or what, but if you're having issues, um, and you really feel like something is wrong, get a second opinion.
4644.28, Um, we had to go through... It was either three or four different doctors that insisted that Rachel had a cold for like three or four months,
4652.28, until we finally got an x-ray and saw that she had literally stage four cancer. Um, it... And like everybody would find this like, oh, you probably just have a cough.
4660.28, Oh, it takes a cough medicine. Oh, you know, maybe you have some at Moxas telling you like, you're good. You know, you're gonna...
4664.28, Like, if you feel like something is super wrong, get a second opinion. Don't just like walk away from a hospital.
4667.28, If you're like bleeding and shit is like super fucked. I would definitely say, uh, I would definitely recommend getting like a second or even a third opinion if you feel like you need to.
4675.28, Um, now if you're a fucking hypochondriac, you're a medicine shopping, fuck you.
4679.28, But if you seriously feel like something is wrong, yeah, shop for like a second or third opinion.
4683.28, I agree, but like ectopic pregnancies are not that rare compared to stage four cancer to young person.
4687.28, Like, they're like, yeah, true. Um, and it's probably something you could look out for. Yeah, sure.
4693.28, But...
4696.28, And it didn't make sense. And I would call the advice nurse and they would say, oh, you're probably gassy.
4702.28, And so, you know what? I did take things like gas-ex and stuff and I'm like, I don't think this is helping and I'm still in a lot of pain.
4712.28, And you know what? It's just so frustrating too, because I know at multiple visits, I did request imaging and I never got it.
4721.28, Like, not like the imaging where like they go on top of the tummy because that's not in depth. Like, I asked for like more intensive imaging like where they actually go in.
4731.28, And they wouldn't do it. And I really wish that they would have.
4737.28, I was at work.
4739.28, Wait, October 22nd, like the same October 22nd or one year? No, she said it was one year ago, right? This is a year ago, I think, right?
4746.28, You know, trying to suck it up. And then all of a sudden, the weirdest painful sensation came over me again.
4755.28, But this time, it made me really dizzy and faint and my heart was just... Oh, this is 28, okay.
4761.28, I had this pain in my lower abdomen. I just knew something was wrong.
4764.28, Don't ectopic pregnancies have to be aborted or will they literally kill you? I think so, but I'm not 100% sure.
4771.28, The problem with a lot of pain for women is it's like it's so different from woman to woman to woman. So it's hard to generalize.
4777.28, For instance, some women have really bad periods and the cramping, they'll call out from work every month.
4784.28, They just can't do it. And other women are like, their stomach is a little like, and that's like their cramps for periods.
4790.28, Some women have pregnancies where it's like, you know, like I think Rachel's hurt, but she didn't even have an epidural.
4797.28, And she like was like, you know, and then other people have really rough pregnancies. They're in labor for a long time.
4803.28, So yeah, my understanding is that a miscarriage can feel like a really rough or bad period.
4812.28, So supposedly a lot of women miscarry and it is just like a rougher period.
4817.28, You don't even realize that you were pregnant. That might not be everybody's experience, but if you're having like earth shattering,
4824.28, debilitating, constant pain or whatever, just from my anecdotal shit and a little bit of red that doesn't sound like a miscarriage to me.
4832.28, That sounds like something worse. Like I said, some crazy shit is happening.
4835.28, Like push through and get a second or third opinion. Like fuck. Yeah.
4840.28, And so I left work early. I called my boyfriend and I told him something's wrong. I'm going to the hospital again.
4849.28, I don't feel well. Something is wrong.
4852.28, And he said, okay, well, I have work to do.
4860.28, And it involves other people and then we're going to go out and get dinner and drinks with them.
4868.28, So I had to go to the hospital alone.
4873.28, And I was there for about four hours by myself.
4878.28, Most of it in the waiting room. Just feeling like I'm dying the whole time.
4886.28, And finally they call me back and they do tests and imaging.
4891.28, And I still remember when they took me down to radiology to do my ultrasound. Finally, I'm getting the in-depth ultrasound.
4899.28, And if you guys know anything about ultrasounds, you know that the texts are not allowed to tell you your diagnosis at all.
4907.28, You have to hear it from a doctor. And so I'm laying there.
4912.28, And I still remember it perfectly.
4916.28, The ultrasound tech is in there. And she seems confused by something.
4924.28, So she gets another tech's input. I don't know if it's like her manager or just another person.
4930.28, And then the other tech goes, yeah.
4933.28, As much as it is fun to shit on her in chat. This is kind of an unwinnable situation.
4937.28, It's not like we have a way to not fuck it up.
4939.28, If he doesn't want the kid, but the girl does, like she's on the wrong for changing her mind.
4942.28, I feel like she should have some way of solving this otherwise it almost encourages men to bully their girlfriends' exes abortions.
4947.28, I mean, all you can do is first of all, it's not about like shitting on anybody.
4951.28, All you can do is like have an agreement beforehand.
4954.28, The problem is that like once the person is pregnant, they have the sole control over everything.
4959.28, And you have no way to escape what is probably, aside from student loans, like the biggest financial responsibility of your life.
4965.28, You know? The comments on Gus's videos over only shit on alone. Shit on alone? Is that her name?
4973.28, Overwhelmingly shit on alone. It's pretty fucked.
4977.28, He seems to be painted as a fucked up manipulator.
4981.28, I mean like I can't, like, I don't have eyes into their relationship.
4986.28, So it's hard to say what happened.
4989.28, But I mean if she's been to the hospital a ton, if she's already had like conversations with him about canceling abortion,
4994.28, it wouldn't surprise me if their relationship was ultra-ultra-ultra-rocky at this point.
4998.28, I think that if I discussed an abortion with somebody and we were going to, I'll say it with fucking Molina,
5004.28, if we discussed and we're like, yeah, we're gonna abortion to be pregnant until we're ready, blah blah blah.
5007.28, If she got pregnant and then said that she was considering an abort, or she was considering not doing it,
5012.28, I would probably stay with her until we got the abortion and then I think I would dump her and never talk to her again.
5017.28, I think I would leave completely 100%. It's just like, it's just way too scary.
5021.28, Unless the person is saying some shit like, no, no, I don't think there's any, I think it's just way too much.
5026.28, It's way, way, way, way, way too much. Like, it's so, so, so, so scary.
5031.28, That's her uterus. And then the original text says, no. That's her uterus.
5038.28, And I'm just laying there like, what are you talking about? What's happening?
5045.28, And they wouldn't tell me anything. Of course, because that's part of, you know, their job.
5049.28, Like, they can't just in case they're wrong. They need a doctor to look at it.
5054.28, So finally, they sent me back upstairs.
5057.28, How can you hold pro-choice positions and this one, genuine question? What are you talking about?
5062.28, I don't know where the conflict where you even potentially hypothetically see a conflict here. I don't know what you're talking about.
5067.28, Alone. And my phone is dying. I'm hoping that my boyfriend can come.
5075.28, Okay, people keep saying paper abortions. The problem with paper abortions is that the state doesn't want a kid that's not financially provided for.
5081.28, Because there's like a whole bunch of weird like shit that can be brought in if you're allowed to get a paper abortion.
5085.28, Like, if the father has the money to pay, it's probably in the state and the child and the mother's best interest for the father to pay.
5091.28, That's the issue, what happens is like child support isn't a matter of what's fair to the mom and what's fair to the father.
5096.28, It's a matter of what's like in the best interest of the child, even if it's unfair to any of the other parties.
5100.28, That's why child support is the way that it is.
5106.28, As soon as he can. And I decide because I parked at like a high up level, I'm like, well, since it's nighttime now, I don't want to have to take the elevator or stairs because I won't feel safe.
5119.28, I'm going to move my car to the first level now that it's starting to clear up. And I get in my car and I didn't put my seatbelt on.
5127.28, I was in a parking garage, I was going like five miles an hour. And something about the beep of the seatbelt that needed to be clicked was just so ominous and foreshadowing.
5138.28, It sounded like a heart monitor. I just knew there was something wrong. I just knew it. Parked my car, got my truck.
5145.28, Okay, Dustin, you have no clue what he said. He could have actually pressured her. He can leave her if she decides to hit the kid. That's his right and I would do the same.
5153.28, I'm calling her an appeal with this information psychotic. I'm not going to wait. It wouldn't surprise me if he did try to pressure her, but I don't even know if that's necessarily wrong on his part.
5161.28, He's looking at what could be the largest financial and life relationship obligation coming out of nowhere that he thought he'd already agreed would never happen.
5171.28, It wouldn't surprise me if he was trying to pressure her a little bit, especially if you feel like somebody's about to renege on a situation like that. That's super, super, super scary.
5178.28, He can leave her if she decides to hit the kid. He could, but one, he's still probably going to want some relationship with that kid, where the kid is at some point going to want a relationship with him, and then two, he's going to be on the hook for Childsport for 18 years.
5189.28, It's a rough one, my dude.
5196.28, Destiny, it's not just about the best of the child and the state would pay. There are obviously assigning blame to the parents if they are the first to pay. No, you're wrong. One, the state already does pay. There's plenty of financial assistance for single parents.
5207.28, Things like the earned income tax credit gives you more money if you've got it dependent and you're working. And two, there's literally a child tax credit for children.
5215.28, Three, there are other things like food assistance programs. You've got SNAP. You've got things called WIC, which stands for women infants and children, which is literally for people pregnant or like new mothers that can't afford food for their children.
5226.28, So the state does pay when they can. But the thing is there's a financial obligation from the father as well, because the state doesn't want to just take on all of that financial obligation if there's another responsible party that can pay as well.
5235.28, Charger, when inside, charge my phone. Yeah, sorry. Pressuring her into taking an abortion is wrong no matter what. It's her body, her choice, having conversations about that, putting in your view, absolutely pressuring. No, that is manipulative.
5248.28, What? If you have, if you sign an agreement with someone, well, not sign it, but you're probably gonna have a rule again. If you say, okay, if you get pregnant, you're gonna have an abortion. We both agree with that, right? Like you'll go to the hospital, you'll be there with your pay for it if you have to. Everything's fine. Okay.
5260.28, You have a conversation about that. You agree with that. And then they get pregnant and they change their mind. You think that that's okay, that you just fuck to that point? It's their choice to kill back on that agreement and fuck you harder financially than almost anything else in your life. Can I ever fuck you? You think that's fair?
5273.28, Finally, it seems like boyfriend is on his way, so that's nice.
5293.28, Hold on. If that's your view, kids telling each other, yeah, we'll marry one day is binding then? Damn, dude. Sounds to me like your mom changed her mind as she shouldn't have.
5306.28, Buy your band. Don't come back. You're actually fucking stupid. Buy. All right, we're listening to this again. All right.
5313.28, Up the beep of the seat belt that needed to be clicked was just so ominous and foreshadowing. It sounded like a heart monitor. I just knew there was something wrong. I just knew it.
5326.28, Parked my car, got my charger, went inside, charged my phone. Finally, it seems like boyfriend is on his way, so that's nice. And he comes right in time to get the diagnosis.
5337.28, I had an ectopic pregnancy in my left fallopian tube. It ruptured. I've been bleeding internally ever since. They were surprised I wasn't dead.
5351.28, And that if I don't have surgery right then and there, I was going to die for sure.
5358.28, And as an added bonus, the surgery might not go well and I might die during that too. So here, this is so dramatic. Holy shit. We got like the camera zooms and everything. Geez.
5371.28, Work because you don't have a choice anymore.
5376.28, Is that clicking sound you? It's the fireplace. Are you talking about this? That's me.
5382.28, There's like a fire in the background. Okay, we'd have more crying.
5387.28, It just really felt like my body, my choice, never got to even apply to me. Okay. And that part really sucked.
5403.28, So, yeah, for those of you who are wondering in my nose video that I recently uploaded about when I talked about the traumatic OR experience that I had, there it is a month ago for my nose.
5424.28, I was in a totally safe environment safe OR. I just, the PTSD, I just had a moment. I felt like I was back in that first Kaiser Permanente OR all over again and I burst into tears and had a panic attack.
5440.28, Yeah, it's really affected me ever since. Anyway, the surgery ended up starting at like 10 or 11. It ended around two, one or one a.m. or two a.m. something like that.
5454.28, Barely remember coming out of it. I think I remember asking Dr. Friend, which is funny that the on call surgeon was named Dr. Friend. She was very, very kind about it. But they went in there with a little laparoscopic surgery and they made two incisions right here on my lower abdomen and they also went in through my belly button.
5477.28, Yeah, my entire left fallopian. Wait, trigger one exploded. Hold on.
5485.28, So I don't have that anymore. She was able to save my ovaries. So that's nice. They're just kind of like stuck onto the actual uterus. So I still have them for like hormone purposes.
5500.28, I can't use them. So there go half my ovaries. And now I'm at a higher risk of having this happen to me again if I ever become pregnant again.
5513.28, You know, they say, oh, yeah, people have ectopic pregnancies and they end up having children later. But I don't read a lot about what happens. Like if you have like an ectopic rupture, that's what I'm a little scared of.
5527.28, Anyway, so surgery finished. And I didn't even consent to this because clearly, like I was under like general anesthesia and barely waking up. I did not consent to being kicked out at 3 a.m.
5537.28, But they did. They wheeled me out. And I couldn't even really stand up all that well by myself. I was extremely nauseous and it was awful.
5550.28, And a boyfriend drove me back to his place because I still didn't get to tell anybody. Right before surgery.
5559.28, Just in case it did go wrong, I called my mom and I just I lied and I said it was I want to bury and sis. It's not a big deal. But I just want to let you know what hospital I'm at.
5567.28, Don't come. So you don't want anybody to find out. Don't come.
5573.28, But yeah, I didn't really tell her how severe it was.
5582.28, I remember even before surgery too, once I found out what was about to happen, I called my sister and I'm like, Oh, hey, I'm at the hospital.
5591.28, And the first thing she says in the most judgmental voice is what you're pregnant.
5597.28, I'm like, okay. Yeah, I'm not telling you anything. So I also lied to her and told her it was a sin ovarian cyst.
5607.28, Yeah, I haven't really been able to tell people about this over the years.
5615.28, Just kind of had to keep it to myself. And it sucks because this thing has changed my life so much.
5627.28, I am not the same person I used to be.
5630.28, This after that, not only do you have like the natural like postpartum of not being pregnant anymore.
5638.28, My hormones after that rupture were just all over the place. And I, there were like some little complications even from surgery after.
5647.28, I would just have lots of random moments of just being thrown into that feeling of what it felt to be dying all over again at random.
5658.28, I had no control over it. And the only person I could really lean on was my boyfriend because I couldn't tell anybody.
5668.28, And I don't fully blame him because that is a lot of responsibility to put on a single person.
5674.28, But he started to get real sick of me.
5677.28, I couldn't sleep by myself for the longest time. So I was over at his place and I'm sure his roommates, you know, love that.
5686.28, But I was just broken for a really long time.
5694.28, I was trying to put myself through therapy. I would try to take myself to the doctor whenever, you know, stuff would spike.
5702.28, It was just the worst. And boyfriend started to resent me.
5708.28, And so I tried bottling it up even more and not telling him until I was absolutely certain that I needed to go to the doctor and I would not be able to drive myself.
5721.28, I tried really hard to be independent, but sometimes I just can't. And those were the moments where I just couldn't.
5729.28, And at one point, he was talking about how hard it was having to take care of me when I would have those moments.
5743.28, My deal, I never stopped him from doing anything or going anywhere. He still continued to live his life as if nothing ever happened.
5752.28, You guys want to make videos like this? Okay. Get cheaper eyeliner so that it runs better. Get that real good. All the...
5760.28, And there I am in the background and the shadows just trying to pretend that I don't feel like I'm dying.
5770.28, It's really hard.
5775.28, And then he would sometimes tell me things like, you know, someone else would have left you by now, right?
5789.28, So the lack of support was really hard.
5795.28, And I had to put myself through therapy to try to minimize these episodes because I don't want that.
5805.28, And I don't want to get hooked on like Xanax or Adavant to try to like take the edge off whenever I feel it's starting to creep on, even though it did work.
5815.28, But I mean, no, no, Benzo's are just the worst. Never get reliant on those. It was awful.
5824.28, And I would get to the point where I would ask for help, take me to urgent care, please. I can't drive myself.
5830.28, And he would say like, oh, well, call the advice nurse and then I'll take you.
5836.28, And then he would insist on listening to the phone call to make sure that I wasn't exaggerating my symptoms or even when he would come with me to the few times to the doctor, he would sit in and correct the doctor on things that I was saying from his point of view.
5853.28, Because he didn't want me to exaggerate my symptoms.
5856.28, That was a lot. But it just felt like I had to grow up even faster.
5865.28, And it sucked.
5866.28, And one of the worst things about Kaiser is you can't even sue them.
5870.28, If you're a Kaiser Permanente member, you automatically waive your rights to take them to court and you have to use like their own arbitration system.
5880.28, So nothing ever came out of that. Don't have a fallopian tube anymore.
5886.28, I got dismissed multiple times by multiple doctors.
5889.28, I was refused when I asked for imaging.
5892.28, And the thing is, if we would have caught this sooner when it comes to ectopic pregnancies, there is a shot that you can have.
5900.28, She's in a hot tub in this.
5902.28, That would make the pregnancy and then you won't have a ruptured fallopian tube.
5906.28, But I didn't get to have that.
5908.28, I didn't even know what an ectopic pregnancy was.
5911.28, Nobody has ever taught me that. Nobody tells you how often even a miscarriage is likely to happen.
5917.28, The education system really feels this.
5920.28, So I feel bad for the people that had the displeasure of meeting me ever since then.
5927.28, Because I don't even know who that sad shell of a person was.
5933.28, I used to be like a really bright energetic bubbly person and I'm starting to get bits and pieces of that back now.
5939.28, But for the longest time, I was just like an awkward uncomfortable energy presence around people.
5946.28, There was just no way to explain why.
5949.28, Now I'm not the smartest person in the world by any means. I'm actually quite mimbo.
5954.28, So I'm going to put some resources and description down below about ectopic pregnancies, about miscarriages,
5960.28, about what to expect from pregnancy at all or what to expect if you don't want to be pregnant and you find that you are.
5967.28, I'm going to include that in the description below.
5970.28, But I highly, highly, highly encourage you. If you ever find out that you are pregnant, try your best to make sure that whatever you decide to do is your choice.
5984.28, Because my biggest regret is not having one.
5988.28, Thanks for listening to my story.
5991.28, And the real one too.
5994.28, Thank you everybody for listening to the story again.
5998.28, Just a heads up if you are still here.
6001.28, An ad for Fabulous is about to be played so that way I can pay for my rent and my healthcare and never use Kaiser again.
6013.28, Thanks for understanding everybody.
6015.28, Bye.
6016.28, This video is sponsored by Fabulous.
6019.28, Why do you need Fabulous? Fabulous is the number one self-care app to help you build-

6046.28, Hello?
6047.28, What?
6048.28, What is, uh...
6050.28, What's going on in here? Is there anything you...
6053.28, Watching videos where you missed everything so...
6056.28, Oh.
6057.28, Was it a good video?
6060.28, Um...
6061.28, I don't know. I mean it was like...
6062.28, Yeah, I don't know.
6063.28, I mean, I...
6064.28, Gus could never make any video defending himself here because he's always going to look in the wrong and horrible and bad.
6069.28, I don't think he did anything especially egregious. I understand there was probably a huge breakdown in the relationship.
6074.28, It is possible that he did a lot of horrible things. It's also possible she did a lot of horrible things.
6078.28, Or it's possible that it just kind of turned into a talk-screw relationship.
6080.28, But there's not enough here for me to be like, wow, what a horrible piece of shit.
6083.28, Um, I don't know, in my opinion.
6085.28, I see.
6086.28, Well...
6087.28, Um...
6088.28, Yeah.
6090.28, Sounds like it's a lose-lose situation.
6093.28, Well, no, it's just a lose situation for him because she got a sick ass 500,000-view video out of it and a lot of people probably going to attack Gus over at some.
6101.28, What about...
6103.28, Okay, no, I just don't even want to comment on this.
6106.28, So, I want to give you a story today.
6110.28, Would you like to hear it?
6112.28, Um...
6113.28, Sure.
6115.28, Yeah, you're excited. Like, I know like, you know, it's kind of like a...
6118.28, It's like a learning thing for everyone here. Like, you'll put...
6121.28, Maybe you'll pick up on it once you... maybe you won't, okay? So here's the deal.
6125.28, Today, we'll be the b- uh...
6128.28, Uh...
6129.28, Can you give me like, three seconds and then we can...
6131.28, There you can tell me?
6132.28, Mm-hmm.
6133.28, Okay.
6134.28, This is the stuff she's liking on her Twitter. Good. Is a domestic victim survivor?
6138.28, What is a DV survivor? Domestic victim? I thought it was a DV, domestic abuse? I don't know, whatever, DV.
6143.28, Oh, domestic violence, probably.
6144.28, It's a domestic violence survivor. When she said, you said, you know I was able to love you by now, disgusting and I cried for her.
6151.28, I would be donating my merch to yours to Goodwill. Oh my God.
6157.28, Oh, and she's liking replies to Gus.
6159.28, Can somebody confirm, is it true that she sat on this for like, two or three years?
6163.28, And she just made this video like, three weeks after they broke up?
6167.28, Is that actually true?
6169.28, What a... what a sigma grind, dude.
6174.28, Yeah, I fucked this. This whole video is a... I just... I super don't care. I have zero empathy for her.
6181.28, Uhh, ectopic pregnancy sucks and everything related to that sucks, but everything else is just... I super don't care.
6188.28, This is like a super huge, like, give me attention and I want to fucking take somebody else down. Bullshit.
6192.28, Okay, sorry. What's up?
6194.28, Uh...
6196.28, Okay. Well, can we take this off the screen when I'm chatting?
6201.28, Okay, I need something a little bit more upbeat. Maybe a fireplace or something?
6206.28, Uh-huh.
6207.28, Uh, okay.
6209.28, So, okay. So today, I had a brain blast. Okay, a brain blast is, at least to me, these are moments where all the pieces come together and it's like your fucking house and your solving a fucking medical mystery.
6226.28, Okay? So, my brain blasts are like ideas. Like, you know, typically like tech startup type shit.
6231.28, So anyways, I'm gonna go through some stuff here and maybe you'll pick up on this, but this is interesting.
6237.28, So, here's the idea. I'm gonna put it out there for chat to scrutinize.
6242.28, So, a very cheap way of advertising on Twitch is donations. It's incredibly cheap.
6248.28, So, you might have a streamer that has 10 or 20,000 live concurrent viewers.
6253.28, Yeah, for $5 or $10, you get like an actual video ad in front of all of them kind of serious.
6258.28, It's unbelievably a crazy value, right?
6261.28, But what are the roadblocks here? So, if you're a big advertiser and you want to like go out and do a big drop there, like first off, you don't know who's online.
6269.28, You don't know what categories they're in. You don't know if they support TTS or donations or anything along those lines.
6275.28, And there's nothing that automates it. So, even if you did have that, you'd have to go one by one by one and submit the thing through streamlabs.
6281.28, So, the thought is, what about if you created a platform where an advertiser can come in and they can say, here's $500 and then you take that $500.
6290.28, And you automate the donation going out to all of the people.
6296.28, There's a whole bunch of shit there. You can schedule it.
6298.28, You just need bots to make multiple accounts because obviously that don't account is going to end up getting blocked by whatever platform, right?
6304.28, So, that was the thought. So, this idea, if I can kind of pull chat here, okay?
6316.28, Do you think this is a good idea or a bad idea? So, just...
6320.28, Well, what do you mean from whose perspective? You got to ask...
6324.28, From only from the business owners.
6328.28, From the business owner, that's a great...
6330.28, For a business owner, it's a great idea. From a streamer, it's a shit idea.
6334.28, And from a viewer, it's a shit idea. But for the business itself, it's a really good idea, of course.
6338.28, Okay, so, here's why your brain blast can sometimes be deceiving.
6346.28, So, what I did, I was like, okay, is this a real thing or is this bullshit?
6352.28, So, I passed one of my redact minions today to literally go and donate a message to 50 streamers with five bucks that were online with Texas Speech-enabled.
6364.28, And I was looking at the results that came in from that. And...
6368.28, This is a failure of an idea for so many reasons.
6372.28, And I'm sure you know all of them, but I'll say them for people who don't. This is the worst idea ever, okay?
6376.28, This idea is one of those things that sounds so good.
6380.28, And you're like, oh my God, this is amazing. And then you test it. And you're like, this is the worst thing ever.
6384.28, Okay, so number one, it's bad, is that no one fucking went through. Even when you're like, hey, you know, go to website.
6390.28, Click throughs are really hard if you don't have something for them to click on. That's a really rough one.
6394.28, People don't manually type in a URL, it's almost never gonna have any.
6396.28, So, that's the first thing. So, when it goes through, you're gonna get some really bad...
6402.28, I'm talking about for all of it, I think we're talking about 50 viewers total.
6406.28, So, there's that. Second thing, is streamers do not like this or appreciate it very much at all.
6412.28, And the reaction you're getting is not good either.
6414.28, So, when you're doing it, it's a lot of like, don't fucking do this.
6418.28, Dude, this site is fucking bullshit. Now, I don't... Yeah. And then some streamers, when you do it to them, they're like...
6424.28, The complete negative reaction. One of them said, like, oh, I bet they steal your fucking passwords.
6429.28, But anyways, the whole point of the story is that...
6433.28, It's good to test stuff. It was interesting. I woke up and it was like a good idea.
6437.28, And I thought this was like something a lot of people would use, because I was thinking like, oh, I would use this if it existed.
6442.28, And then you go and you find out. It's just... It's not good.
6447.28, But I thought it was good. But anyways, that was it.
6450.28, Wow. Thanks.
6452.28, I feel like that's a very sarcastic... Like, I just gave like some business cat advice for free.
6458.28, And now I get shit on. That's how you do it, right?
6461.28, Instead of wasting tens of thousands of dollars seeing if this is like a cool idea and building it out and all that other shit,
6467.28, you spend 250 bucks and find out that you're a moron. Just right then and there.
6472.28, I bet there's a more sophisticated way you could do it.
6475.28, You could do it...
6477.28, Astro-Turf?
6479.28, Hard. So like for instance, if somebody's going over like a League stream or whatever, you can do it and be like,
6484.28, hey, why don't you ever use something like Redactide Dev to delete tweets if you're worried about stuff like this?
6488.28, Like kind of like an Astro-Turf, like pretend you're like a normal whatever.
6492.28, That's like so topical, right?
6494.28, Yeah, no, no. It would be hard to like, you wouldn't do like huge inventory sales this way, right?
6497.28, Because you'd have to have like individualized fucking specific situation targeted, like ad campaign.
6501.28, It would be really, really hard to do that, yeah?
6504.28, Yeah.
6506.28, I agree. And I think even then, I wonder if the click-throughs are going to be anything at all, right?
6511.28, It's probably going to be low.
6513.28, Yeah, so that was it basically.
6515.28, Just, yeah, just not good.
6519.28, It makes me wonder about all this stuff. I think the only thing that might work is actual streamer-based activations,
6527.28, meaning like you actually get fucking Destiny to go and make a video about Redact and he's showing it on screen and talking about it.
6533.28, Well, that's how you, you just like reinvented normal activations, right?
6537.28, No, no, no, I'm saying like maybe that works, right? But I think as far as, I guess the value of TTS is nothing, basically.
6546.28, In terms of advertising, it's so normalized on a streamer, whatever that like people probably hear.
6550.28, A lot of people probably don't even listen to it if it doesn't have like the right name, they just ignore it, right?
6554.28, Yeah, you essentially have to somehow make it so engaged. But that basically, yeah, as you said.
6558.28, So anyways, that was it.
6560.28, Yeah, that was the big meme of the day today is me being sad that it didn't work, but that's fine.
6569.28, You know?
6570.28, Oh, I'm sorry.
6571.28, It's okay. It's good because now you don't-
6574.28, I don't have to wonder, you know?
6576.28, You don't have to wonder, like what could be, right?
6579.28, True.
6580.28, Thing.
6581.28, Yeah, I guess like Cash App had a lot of success, but they certainly did this and I think it was-
6587.28, Fucking dub stack.
6588.28, I don't know how that went.
6590.28, I think your click theory is going to be way higher because you actually got a link being posted in chat.
6593.28, I think that helps.
6594.28, And you've got people creating accounts to try to win money to giveaways are really good at getting people to make accounts.
6599.28, Now, I don't know what the average value of an account created is, but yeah.
6603.28, Yeah, I suppose so.
6605.28, So, um, MMMM, how's everything else going?
6609.28, Oh, I'm okay.
6610.28, Debating Lauren Southern in one and one half hours.
6615.28, Um, we've got a new company, Meta, which we have a 10 minute video on.
6619.28, We've got a debate.
6620.28, I think they're entirely cursed with Denver just-
6622.28, So, non-vigorous listen to women less when they report pain.
6624.28, Okay.
6625.28, And then we've got cops arresting an HDF agent.
6626.28, Stop talking about the noise.
6627.28, I'm getting sued.
6628.28, That's what we got on deck right now.
6631.28, So, I'm curious if anyone in chat has been-
6634.28, Thanks for the chill streams.
6635.28, Or you has been taken down certain YouTube rabbit holes lately.
6640.28, For some reason, I have videos of people smelting random fucking metals with like forges and turning them into fucking iron bars.
6649.28, I don't know how this got into my fucking feed.
6652.28, Um, I have- Yeah, it's just- I have all sorts of like weird shit that's like coming into my feed lake.
6658.28, I don't- I don't understand why.
6660.28, Um, I just ended up turning off all the recommended shit.
6664.28, So, I don't get like any recommendations on anything anymore.
6669.28, Listen, I'm telling you right now you're gonna really enjoy the, um, the audit, the audit or whatever feed.
6676.28, That's like fucking- that's great.
6677.28, You have cops that essentially are fake cops getting arrested.
6681.28, It is the best shit.
6682.28, I'm pumped.
6683.28, I don't think you are actually.
6687.28, I'm not pumped.
6688.28, I don't get that much.
6690.28, Um...
6691.28, Hmm.
6692.28, Fuck, I beat Riftbreaker.
6700.28, Now what?
6701.28, I don't care about the New York Times.
6702.28, I don't care about the written house video-
6704.28, They send trial now.
6705.28, I don't care if they send-
6706.28, When I had my first kidney stone, the staff were ultra sounding my balls that day to check for cancer.
6711.28, Just- let's just wait for the court case to finish.
6713.28, Why would I want to watch fucking YouTube people put together shit about it?
6716.28, I'm just a meditation.
6717.28, Oh yeah, what's the name of the Epic Games launcher?
6721.28, This girl was Red Flag City Jesus.
6730.28, It's called Epic Games launcher, so I probably don't have it if I can't.
6735.28, Oh, because I would need this for like Fortnite for fucking night.
6739.28, Uh...
6740.28, You've been me-o.
6742.28, Here's a gripe, okay?
6746.28, I don't understand.
6748.28, There's a class of people, so this actually comes back to that, um...
6752.28, There's that YouTuber, he does like these movies, like fucking melting shit down into bars, right?
6758.28, As I said, some people have their, like, personality attached to fucking beer in a very strange way.
6768.28, Like, I don't know if you've seen this before, but like, people will make a video and then they'll stop and show them cracking open a beer and like putting their feet up.
6775.28, And it's very strange to me, um, like this obsession with beer, um, and just showing that they're like doing it.
6783.28, Do you have any idea behind the shit or what?
6787.28, I don't know, there's a beer like the You Drink It to like, relax and shit.
6790.28, That's like your, and then people do that?
6793.28, I guess, it's just very...
6795.28, Okay, everyone who does the fucking Who Is He Talking To thing is getting banned.
6798.28, It's a dumb meme, okay?
6799.28, I don't know.
6800.28, Go ahead, do it right now, because I wanted to spend some fucking bands.
6803.28, Go ahead, ask me who I'm talking to.
6805.28, Okay, dark on, see ya.
6813.28, No, keep going. Please, keep asking me.
6816.28, That's your mom.
6817.28, She's coming over here.
6818.28, I'm gonna fuck her right now.
6819.28, She's at the front door.
6820.28, Jesus Christ, damn.
6834.28, How far have you gotten in Darkest Dungeon 2, Dan?
6836.28, A few days behind you.
6837.28, So I've already beat it.
6840.28, Yeah.
6841.28, What difficulty are you playing it on?
6843.28, I don't know. Good question, Dan.
6858.28, Why are you so fucking tired?
6860.28, Can you get a grip?
6861.28, It's like, EPM right now.
6862.28, Okay, stop.
6863.28, Stop fucking yawning.
6864.28, It's making me yawn.
6865.28, Sorry, I don't mean to get aggressive here, but like, control yourself, okay?
6871.28, Okay, let me get a...
6873.28, Yeah, I hate that shit.
6876.28, Watching a streamer, they yawn, all of a sudden I'm yawning.
6879.28, Hold on, let me get a candy bar, okay?
6880.28, I need some of those simple sugars in my body.
6906.28, Alright, let's go.
6913.28, Oh no, it's the dono chat voice.
6923.28, I saw a guy at the gym yesterday morning.
6928.28, Old dude.
6929.28, Pretty frail.
6930.28, He was shaking, walking from place to place.
6933.28, And for a chat.
6936.28, And he had a bug wiser with him.
6937.28, I can't have beer.
6938.28, Hell, you mentioned it.
6939.28, I didn't know it was based, man.
6941.28, You do you, man.
6942.28, I don't know if you were supposed to drink beer and work out, but, hey, man.
6946.28, That's your routine.
6947.28, If that's what gets you out of...
6948.28, That's what gets you to the gym, then fucking go for it.
6952.28, I awaken to the sight of the sun setting over the horizon.
6955.28, My thirst is unsatiable.
6956.28, I desire the blood of the innocent.
6958.28, My mind is as blank as my Twitter profile thanks to Redactiv.
6961.28, My hunt begins.
6962.28, If only I were a marketing godlike Scott Bradley.
6967.28, Hi, Pardustys Madlow.
6968.28, Robert has the lowest COVID rates with no mandates proving that these mandates are not needed.
6988.28, What?
6997.28, Well, Dan, that was very useful.
7000.28, Do you know what is also useful?
7002.28, I feel like I'll face them.
7003.28, It deletes your online presence automatically on multiple sites and applications like Facebook,
7008.28, Twitter, and Discord.
7013.28, Fuck you, Dan.
7017.28, Wait, it was Mike from BA.
7020.28, It was Central Committees.
7021.28, One of the chats that you advertised in.
7023.28, I don't know.
7024.28, Bush fries.
7025.28, He did it to everyone he knew.
7026.28, I think Casey Tron got it as well.
7028.28, It was a lot of other people.
7029.28, Juzo.
7030.28, Hey, Dan.
7031.28, Shut the frick up.
7032.28, Bush fries is frick up.
7033.28, I said shut the frick up.
7034.28, You know what I'm talking to?
7036.28, He's loyal.
7037.28, He belongs to me.
7038.28, Who is this old man and why does he sound like me?
7041.28, I'm...
7046.28, Three more donors on the call-out blog.
7049.28, Listen, I have no problem with Central Committee.
7051.28, I tried to have him make money with American Airlines stock.
7056.28, Dude, I don't know what my Epic Games plugin is.
7060.28, So, anyways, back to those smelting videos.
7064.28, Oh, God.
7065.28, Do I even have an Epic Games account?
7066.28, I played Fortnite once, right?
7070.28, What's the key?
7073.28, Who's he talking to?
7074.28, They're Welch's fruit snacks.
7078.28, Just connect with your Steam account.
7080.28, Well, but don't I already have games and shit on those?
7085.28, Yay.
7090.28, I used LastPass.
7091.28, Why the fuck?
7092.28, No, I'm good.
7093.28, Fuck you.
7098.28, I'm good.
7103.28, So, anyways, guys, this dude was in the smelterate without shoes on,
7107.28, might I add, and smelting up these iron bars.
7110.28, I don't know why these videos keep getting recommended in my feed.
7113.28, Do you like your YouTube recommendations, Steve?
7115.28, I also have a micro penis.
7118.28, Stop.
7120.28, Can you just change your fucking donation voice to, like, Mr. Bootton or something?
7123.28, It's getting boring, as may.
7126.28, Do you guys think it's getting boring?
7128.28, Take a poll and chat.
7129.28, Show me, prove it to me.
7134.28, God damn it.
7135.28, I needed a global entry so bad, Dan.
7138.28, Why don't you have it?
7140.28, There's probably going interviews.
7142.28, I mean, you're supposed to do them any way back into the country,
7144.28, but I haven't, like, scheduled, like, an appropriate flight,
7146.28, because I'm usually connecting somewhere.
7147.28, I don't have time to wait around, like, four hours for the fucking global entry.
7150.28, Wait, you can just schedule it now.
7152.28, Like, you don't have to be on a flight.
7154.28, You can do it without being on a flight.
7156.28, When a long time ago, I was thinking they canceled all of it.
7158.28, There was, like, one appointment available, like, eight months into the future,
7161.28, unironically.
7162.28, Is it easier to schedule now?
7163.28, I have no fucking idea, because that's how I did mine, but that was, like, a year ago.
7167.28, So, or no, more than a year ago.
7169.28, You're a fucking sedition!
7186.28, Clear is awesome.
7188.28, Which...
7189.28, Do you have TV say, pre?
7191.28, Yep.
7192.28, Is that the same thing as Clear, or is it different, or do you know if it's better, or worse, or...
7197.28, It's different. Clear is useful at, I think, Denver Airport, and...
7203.28, Every major airport I've been to, I've seen it has been clear.
7206.28, And I just, like, show my shit now, let me go right to the front of the line.
7209.28, Yeah, but it's only at some that it's, like, worth usually TSA pre-tech, as more partners.
7214.28, But I mean, you can use them together.
7216.28, I've changed my mind.
7217.28, I don't know if I can't get the phone, but I'll use it no more.
7220.28, I feel like I've outpaced him intellectually.
7227.28, Oh!
7229.28, It's helped me harder, Daddy.
7230.28, I also stopped caring about the global entry ship because Molina wasn't fucking American, so it didn't matter.
7236.28, Is she done traveling to Sweden now?
7240.28, Like, how does it...
7241.28, So now she's in the US, so now we have to get...
7243.28, Fuck you, man, I'm taking over.
7244.28, Very thing, but League streams as far as the ice can see.
7247.28, And B.W. just won.
7250.28, Probably, we're probably just going to try to go to court.
7251.28, I've got the paperwork filled out as quickly as possible.
7252.28, Because once she's once we're married, then she can file for an adjustment of status, I think.
7256.28, And then that's, like, waiting for the green card, basically.
7258.28, And then I don't think she can leave the country and sell that adjustment period as well, hopefully.
7263.28, Yes, that is the thing I was going to come up with.
7265.28, Isn't there a significant period of time, like, a year or something, where she can't travel back to Sweden?
7270.28, It's anywhere from, like, eight months to fucking three years.
7273.28, It just depends on how long it takes in a process ship.
7275.28, It might be really short because not that many people are getting those types of visas, or it might be really long because they're not staffing that department, because not many people are getting those types of visas.
7282.28, So, if you're going to be in Miami for this wedding shit, does that mean, like, your mom is going to try and force something to happen?
7287.28, Or are you still, like, going to leave no wedding?
7290.28, I love the glug, glug, glug, damn voice.
7292.28, What do you mean, chat rise up and kill cats?
7294.28, Force something. Wait, say that again?
7296.28, So, since you're going to be in Miami when you get married, are you still planning on having, like, literally no ceremony or no?
7304.28, Oh, I mean, we'll probably do something like that, because I'm only going to probably want to.
7308.28, But the first thing, I don't give a fuck about that stupid shit.
7310.28, The first thing is just going to a court house and doing the paperwork and getting that shit done.
7313.28, So, I'm going to get married as quickly as possible.
7315.28, And then we'll figure out the ceremony shit later, whatever.
7317.28, The most important thing is just getting the paperwork filed.
7319.28, I don't know where we'll actually get to do the ceremony bullshit at, but I just want to get the paperwork filed.
7324.28, Did you have big weddings for your past lives?
7328.28, Fuck, no.
7329.28, We got married for financial aid.
7330.28, That was another courthouse.
7331.28, Although, we dressed up and had friends and shit over and stuff for that.
7335.28, You know, when you get married, that's an opportunity to make money from your viewers.
7349.28, Yeah, I've thought about, like, streaming shit and me even out or something.
7353.28, Why not be fun?
7355.28, Yeah, you know, actually would be fucking. I need that retirement money.
7358.28, Yeah, you really like Steve. You have to start milking them.
7363.28, Listen, I'm doing so many sponsors, okay?
7366.28, As much as I can without ever doing a hardware sponsor because I hate all of them.
7370.28, It fucks me hard, but...
7373.28, I've got an eternal sponsor coming up, Dan.
7375.28, We're going to be chilling NFTs.
7377.28, My VPN sponsor got pushed to three months from one. That's been good.
7381.28, I did a couple of game sponsors in the past couple months.
7384.28, We did that Tower Defense one.
7385.28, I think it was one other one we did.
7388.28, How much could you make off of just sponsorships a month if you are doing well?
7393.28, Assuming I, like, if I...
7397.28, The big thing that fucks me is I don't like to do gear sponsors because I won't use shitty shit.
7402.28, I'm never doing like a... I love you guys, but I'm never going to do a SteelSeries eraser sponsorship.
7405.28, I'm just never going to. I just don't like the products.
7408.28, If I always like to whore out hard and do like all of that shit and everything I could,
7412.28, I don't know. You could probably do like 10 to 20k a month maybe, depending, or maybe more.
7417.28, It just depends. If there was like one sponsor every day, you could do like 100k.
7421.28, I could do 100k a month, but like that's, I'm probably not going to get like that level of like filling, right?
7426.28, Like that fill.
7431.28, Interesting.
7433.28, Just trying to...
7434.28, It sucks.
7435.28, It sucks.
7435.28, It sucks.
7436.28, It sucks.
7437.28, It sucks.
7438.28, It sucks.
7439.28, It sucks.
7440.28, It sucks.
7441.28, I'm not going to get into anybody new because it felt like there was a bunch of streamers that got into it initially.
7444.28, And then I don't know if I got rolled out to more people or not because I feel like I never hear anybody talk about it.
7448.28, Except for like the original people that got into it.
7450.28, I have no idea. I mean, I just, I look into it and there's big money in there.
7455.28, Yeah, if you get into it. Yeah, but I'm not sure.
7457.28, Does anybody here that watches Ms. Kiff, does he still run bounties?
7461.28, I'm seeing guests and no.
7463.28, It's just like, it's just, you know, all the time.
7466.28, Barely.
7467.28, Ask question of chat.
7468.28, Just fucking guess the answer because it's literally like a bunch of fucking monkeys on keyboards.
7473.28, And it's like the answer is out there somewhere, but they're just so fucking stupid.
7477.28, Because half of them have no idea and they just fucking answer anyways.
7481.28, Why?
7482.28, I'm not sure.
7483.28, I'm not sure.
7484.28, I'm not sure.
7485.28, I'm not sure.
7486.28, I'm not sure.
7487.28, I'm not sure.
7488.28, I'm not sure.
7489.28, I'm not sure.
7490.28, Assistant.
7491.28, No really.
7492.28, YesONG gets into that ring.
7493.28, It's.
7494.28, No.
7495.28, Okay, that's okay.
7496.28, So that'd be my really, really cool question.
7498.28, And it's concrete thing.
7499.28, Erasing it.
7500.28, You still haven't seen that,.(that's cool!)
7503.28, I can also say one last.
7506.28, No, you don't actually notice this one.
7508.28, I think somebody did feel it.
7510.32, You hear Lineagues?
7511.4, Second?
7512.28, Up in the Hmm.
7513.28, We, if you honey hapents, spikes are going to hit me.
7515.719999999999, Well, we were like, were there for this at a time?
7517.32, When did Ifully want to hear what Ifers are going to beat me with Ms. Kiff?
7519.5199999999995, Then there's not too many stresses.
7520.26, reuse one of your last five passwords. Dude, I don't remember my... I hate... Oh, I'm gonna wish.
7528.5, We're gonna figure this bad boy out.
7535.06, Oh, I'm so smart. Oh, possibly a hot take. I'm not sure, actually. I don't like Channel 5
7542.58, compared to what it was. I think it's way worse now than it was when they were... When before.
7549.38, You want me to give you a hotter take? Go ahead. I don't think they truly ever got fucked before.
7554.58, Like everybody makes it sound like they got fucked. And everybody in the internet is a loser.
7558.58, My understanding... Now, I'll change my opinion if my understanding of this is incorrect. But my
7563.9400000000005, understanding is that initially that kid didn't have any channel. He didn't have the money to buy
7568.900000000001, camera or crew. He didn't have the money to promote us. He didn't have anything. And this
7571.86, company basically said, we'll take some ownership of your shit or whatever or we get ownership of
7574.82, the channel, but we'll like front you all the cost for this shit to grow. Like, if that's the
7579.06, case, I don't think that kid got fucked at all. I think it was... Everything was like fair. Like,
7583.14, yeah, they own the channel. They're like, they're taking a huge risk on like fronting all the
7585.9400000000005, stuff to know a fan, it's a person that has a low chance of making it. Like, yeah, the all gas,
7591.54, no breaks or whatever is what I'm talking about. Yeah. And then like, it worked out really well
7595.3, for him. It's not like, unless there was some weird shit going on, it's not like he was contracted
7598.42, to run that channel for the rest of his life. Like, he did his contract, he left the channel,
7601.38, he started his own shit, he got really big. Like, it seems like it was a really, really, really good.
7604.58, It seemed like it was a really good deal for him. I think he was upset that he had no ownership
7613.62, is what happened. Yeah, but I'm sorry, but you're a nobody, you're not going to get ownership.
7618.26, You're your kid that wants to go big on YouTube. Who the fuck are you? Why would you expect to
7621.46, ever get ownership, right? Yeah, I don't know. It's like the phase kids thinking that one phase
7627.86, guy got fucked when in reality, he just happened to get fucking huge. And then people were trying
7632.1, to apply like his phase contract to everybody like, oh, phase fucked up. So I was like, no,
7635.3, bro, shut the fuck up. I'll tell you what this is, is a colossal failure on whoever owns all
7640.660000000001, gas, no brakes right now to have not negotiated something absolutely 100%. That's the fuck up.
7645.9400000000005, How could you lose talent like that? Like, you make those big investments, because most of them
7650.02, are going to be losers. But when you get a winner, you go back to the table and be like, bro,
7653.3, congratulations, you made it. We want to get a little bit of this, but we don't want you to
7655.780000000001, feel like you're getting fucked, right? Absolutely. That was a huge fuck up. That's a monumental
7659.7, failure on the company. So stupid. I mean, it's possible that this guy could be completely
7664.74, unreasonable. And he's saying like, I want full ownership of everything. And if you do that,
7669.0599999999995, if you don't do that, I'm walking. I mean, there is people like that, by the way, that are fucking
7672.0199999999995, kind of like mental with negotiating and they just don't understand them. We'll just be like,
7675.94, yeah, I'll take everything and I'll give you five grand a month. We're like, dude, that's a fucking
7679.62, garbage deal. Like, I'll just make more than that literally just running YouTube ads on the channel,
7684.0199999999995, never having another video. So it's possible that in this case that he was actually so unreasonable,
7689.62, that he forced us to happen. Maybe he just felt like he didn't need the brand, but I don't know.
7693.62, I feel like this channel is like, it's dead now. I don't know if any videos have been posted since
7699.3, his last one. But like, what was the point of this? How do you fuck this up so badly? How stupid?
7709.78, Yeah, I also don't like that. I don't know, it feels different now of this. I don't know if he was
7716.74, interjecting himself as much into things now as he was back. Sorry, the other way. I felt like
7723.78, back then, obviously, he was gone to reporting, but now it feels like he's certainly gone from
7728.34, being the reporter to actually injecting himself into the story a little bit more aggressively.
7734.82, He's like really putting himself in there and trying to make himself the star that's talking with
7739.94, people versus the quirky reporter that asks funny questions, I think.
7744.1, Oh, maybe a little bit. Damn, what's going on at LAX? Security alert at Los Angeles International
7748.9800000000005, Airport, all flights grounded. Oh, God. Molina just got here yesterday, right?
7758.900000000001, Could you imagine if I was sitting at the airport through all this bullshit, fuck.
7765.860000000001, After a gun scare forced hundreds of passengers onto the top. Oh, God, there's such a horrible
7770.26, tweet you could make on this. The incident happened around 730 on the internet, I'm trying to do
7776.66, to security. Okay. Post it or you're a bitch. I feel like it's so me, me.
7800.5, Careful, Steven. Think about the sponsors. Do you think this is worth it? So it's kind of spicy,
7816.74, is the entertainment to spicy ratio appropriate or is it just needlessly spicy?
7821.06, Is it going to be a, we're getting danderson off on this one.
7833.06, Is it? Let's see.
7840.26, Um, I would say that it's too niche. Is that too niche? Yeah, people aren't going to know
7846.98, that term except for fucking people that it's also not that spicy. This is like kind of,
7852.58, I mean, I think it's fine, but the only people are going to really understand what this is even
7855.86, fucking referencing is your chat. Okay, I'm sorry. I don't know. You guys tell me if this sounds
7860.74, like nobody would understand about it. So they tweeted security alert at Los Angeles International
7864.74, Airport, all flights grounded because of this gun scare. And my tweet would be a quote tweet,
7868.339999999999, and my quote tweet is in his defense, TSA told him it was cold when they hit him back his firearm.
7873.38, Is that the super niche? Do you think nobody would understand? Is it not spicy at all?
7877.3, I've looked into the Alec Baldwin shit enough to understand the term cold gun.
7884.1, I feel like it's been all over the fucking news.
7886.34, You know, just fuck these psychophantic fucking chatters that you fucking have.
7890.5, You guys are all fucking wrong. No one knows the term fucking cold gun.
7894.58, I don't understand this shit. You guys are fucking delusional.
7897.46, I will tweet it out. We'll see if it does round. We'll see how it goes.
7901.46, If he gets over 3000 like stand, you fucked up. Okay.
7905.3, Now they're just going to do it. The fucking spite me.
7908.1, Maybe it is. Maybe it's super niche. Who knows?
7912.66, Fuck you, Dan.
7914.9800000000005, You know I'm right, too. Like, you know that I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
7917.7, I don't know. I don't know. People are talking about like this fucking story or whatever.
7920.5, Looked into the fucking level. You're like getting fucking blueprints of the
7924.42, shit that's happened. God, just.
7925.62, Just. It's fine. That's fine. Jesus, Dan.
7933.38, I'm just, you know, I don't.
7936.74, This is gaslighting, right? This is where people are like, oh, Dan, you're delusional.
7940.34, No, I'm not.
7946.34, I'm sorry, Dan.
7950.34, Let's go. What's the start mind your ice cream cone?
7952.34, What are you talking about? What ice cream cone?
7959.7, What that old photo?
7961.3, Yeah, with your melting ice cream cone in your hand.
7963.38, Yeah, that's first off, I look like shit in that fucking photo. I don't know fucking why.
7967.78, It's all the fucking stars aligned to give that a fucking bad photo.
7972.26, And that you were there. We're all out. And I'm fucking had an ice cream cone and it's
7978.18, fucking too hot. It's melting all over the fucking place. It's just.
7981.14, Wait, you've seen the movie Pulp Fiction, right? Yeah.
7984.02, Have you seen the fucking Pulp Fiction meme going around? Jesus Christ.
7991.06, That's awesome. Wait, have you not posted that on Twitter? You need to post that.
7995.46, Oh, this is everyone's been posting. It would be an obvious meme Jack. Yeah.
7998.900000000001, Yeah, but that's your style to mean Jack. That's funny.
8001.06, Yeah, but I try not to mean Jack shit that has been like making the rounds on Twitter
8004.02, because then I look like a blatant meme jagger.
8005.86, Linkers, how have you guys not seen this? It's this shit.
8015.219999999999, I mean, you can probably just pull it up in your browser right there.
8021.299999999999, Yeah, I only mean Jack in private.
8024.179999999999, I think like how many games are available on the Epic Games platform?
8027.46, I guess there's a lot of mirrored games trying this in Steam, huh?
8051.94, What do you have to do tonight, down? I have to go to sleep, son.
8055.3, Fuck. Well, you have your thing with Lauren's oven, son.
8059.22, Not until 930. That was an hour.
8064.9800000000005, So when? 930? Yeah, I got an hour, Dan.
8067.86, Oh, why is my fucking stream lagging? Hello? Hello?
8085.299999999999, Did you download Warzone yet? Dan.
8090.98, Is that even the same game anymore?
8093.06, I don't know, Dan. We're legends. Attention men and some women of the H3 subreddit.
8099.38, Stop referring to women as females. It's dehumanizing and insulting.
8104.740000000001, Look to the women in your family who you love and respect.
8106.820000000001, Would you refer to them as a female? Okay, let me explain both sides of this
8111.06, because we do this shit all the time. Okay, I'm sorry.
8115.46, So referring to women as female definitely has a very weird
8121.78, insality connotation to it. But the problem is, is that there is like no casual way
8128.34, to refer to like women that isn't like ultra loaded.
8132.9, So for instance, for guys, guys is like the most neutral term in the world.
8139.139999999999, Like, oh yeah, that guy's cool. I like that guy, right?
8141.54, Every other word for females has a weird connotation to it.
8148.18, So everybody that's saying girls in chat, like maybe if you're 13,
8153.3, but like calling a grown woman a girl kind of sounds a little weird.
8158.1, It's a little bit weird to be like, oh yeah, like this girl,
8161.14, like I'm gonna go hang out with a girl. Like, I mean, I guess when you say like hang out with a girl,
8164.02, like that's okay. But like, oh, like my girl, or this girl that's a doctor, whatever,
8167.9400000000005, this girl that's a doctor, you mean this woman that's, is her girl doctor?
8171.06, Or like, it's just, it's like a weird like girl has a generally very young connotation.
8176.02, Lady sounds like you're mistress. That's just a weird lady. You never say lady.
8180.820000000001, Woman is considered appropriate, but woman sounds like it's such an,
8185.540000000001, it's a very formal, incredibly formal and almost ages a person.
8190.02, Like, I think if you're like 25, you're probably not super excited for other men to refer to you as like,
8195.300000000001, oh, that woman, this woman, like woman makes you sound like you're a parent, like an adult.
8200.9, But yeah, that's like, it's hard because there's not like,
8203.94, there's not like a super neutral. There's not any equivalent to guys for girl or woman.
8209.380000000001, And that's why some people will default to like female, which is also weird, but yeah,
8214.74, I don't know, it sucks.
8217.54, And we got dudes, the best of all the terms.
8222.5, Who's that dude over there? Oh, they, you know, not that dude, the other dude, the best term.
8227.54, My fucking wife says female, I hate it because everyone misinterpreted it all the fucking time.
8230.58, Just like girls get weird, lady sounds neck-birty, ma'am gets you in trouble with pronouns,
8234.02, woman is coming to you with female, et cetera, et cetera.
8235.94, Yeah, I mean, if woman gets there, that'll be cool. Oh, yeah, this woman's cool. But.
8245.22, All right, go watch the cops or a CTF agent. I'm probably going to bed.
8248.66, Just go ahead. It's good. You'll get sucked down the rabbit hole.
8251.22, That channel's got a lot of good shit.
8253.62, Okay.
8253.94, Okay.
8260.74, Linus is so posting again.
8265.060000000001, By the time I actually buy anything, I've been taxed at a rate of 50%.
8267.7, Guess what? I'm still hustling. I'm doing great.
8269.78, Tax the rich.
8271.140000000001, By the time I actually buy, I've been taxed at a rate of 50%.
8273.94, What? 50% taxes?
8279.54, Wait, wait, what?
8280.42, How? What is he talking about?
8287.06, Oh, is he a Canadian? No way. I've been even in Canada.
8290.58, No fucking shot. Do you pay that much? Even in Canada, I don't believe it.
8295.14, I don't believe it.
8316.82, Okay, we're watching this.
8318.82, Good luck.
8319.3, Fuck you, Dan.
8331.699999999999, Welcome to audit the audit, where we sort out the who and what and the right and wrong of police
8336.019999999999, interactions. This episode covers federal jurisdiction, the ATF and warrantless seizures,
8340.9, and comes to us from Buckeye Auditing and Transparency's channel. Be sure to check out
8344.66, the description below and give them the credit that they deserve.
8346.98, Cool. Before we dive into the interaction, I want to give a big thanks to the sponsor of this
8350.82, episode, Surfshark. Surfshark is a premier VPS. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
8356.02, bro. That's my sponsor, chill. Jesus. Three months completely free with 20.
8363.939999999999, What are you thinking? Hold on, only I can offer you these deals, guys. He's lying, okay?
8368.02, His shit doesn't work that code. That's during this episode.
8370.98, On July 7th, 2020, ATF agent James Burke went to a home in Columbus, Ohio to retrieve a weapon
8376.98, from an individual who was not permitted to have firearms. ATF is the alcohol, tobacco,
8384.34, and firearms administration. They do like gun tracing and other weird shit. I don't know if they
8389.699999999999, do weird shit, but that's who the ATF is. Knocked on the door, but the end.
8394.18, Actually, let's look them up. The most thing that I know them for is like gun tracing for crimes,
8398.18, but we can look up ATF. ATF. The Bureau of Alcohol. Oh, the Bureau of, sorry. Alcohol
8408.02, tobacco, firearms and explosives is a domestic law enforcement room. It's not something including
8411.220000000001, investigation prevention of federal offensive, on the goal, unlawful use, manufacturing possession
8414.74, of firearms and explosives, acts of arson and bombings, and illegal trafficking and tax evasion
8418.9, of alcohol and tobacco products. The ATF also regulates the license of the sales
8422.34, administration of firearms, ammunition, and explosives and interstate commerce. Many of the
8425.86, ATF's activities are carried out in conjunction with task forces made up with state and local law
8429.78, enforcement officers such as the Project Safe Neighborhoods. ATF operates a unique
8434.02, fire research laboratory in Belltsville, Maryland, where full-scale markets for criminal arson can
8438.34, be reconstructed. Wow. There you go. Individual inside the home refused to open it and called 911
8447.78, instead. Despite the fact that the caller was
8449.4, the caller, wait, it's a response during this episode. On July 7th, 2020, ATF agent James Burke went to
8455.32, a home in Columbus, Ohio to retrieve a weapon from an individual who was not permitted to have
8459.48, a firearm. Agent Burke knocked on the door, but the individual inside the home refused to open it and
8464.3, called 911 instead. Despite the fact that the caller read the dispatcher, Agent Burke's badge
8469.46, number, officers Joseph Feihy and Kevin Winkle of the Columbus Division of Police were dispatched to
8474.3, investigate the situation as an attempted break-in.
8477.02, Okay, turn around, let me see your hands. Turn around, let me see your hands. Okay, let me see your hands. I need to see some
8483.66, ID. Get on the ground! Get on the ground now! Get on the ground! Get on the ground! Get on the ground now!
8492.94, I'm a federal agent. 917123. I'm a federal agent. Get on-
8497.220000000001, Okay, fuck. I don't know what the audit guy's gonna say. I'm worried we're gonna disagree with everything. Why though?
8501.42, Okay, so let's back up. Since we're so used to seeing the world through the lens of like innocent
8505.9, people that do nothing wrong and blah blah blah blah. Okay, so you just received a call from a police
8510.619999999999, officer. Okay, you just received a call from the police officer. You just received a call from the police officer saying
8516.3, somebody's attempting to break into my house and then who knows what other information was provided.
8521.18, So when you show up, you're gonna be treating this situation as like potentially lethal right off the bat.
8526.46, I don't know if drawing the gun this early, especially when you can see the hands is like a little bit of an
8531.98, overreach, but if this maybe he thinks this guy's armed I'm not sure. But like if this is what you're being called to, like all you can really do is
8541.34, like comply with the cops and let them like finish a quick investigation, make sure it's like this is like almost the equivalent of
8547.98, this is almost the equivalent of getting swatted, right? Where like if somebody's gonna break into your house and like say or
8555.42, somebody's gonna call the cops like hey there's like a hostage situation, remember cops are gonna come in like really heavy handy or whatever you know but yeah but we'll see.
8565.58, Get on the ground! Get on the ground now! Get on the ground!
8572.62, Get on the ground now! I'm a federal agent. 917123. Get on the ground!
8581.02, Get on the ground! We'll figure it out!
8591.02, I'm not getting on the ground.
8595.02, Well the state where you're at. Fine. Why do you gotta make this harder than it is?
8599.9, Listen, I have no problem making this.
8605.02, I'm not ever reacting. We gotta call the someone's impersonating a police officer out here and don't have ID.
8615.02, No kidding because she doesn't want to open up. Okay, get on the ground so I can find out who you are.
8619.02, It ain't happening. Okay, fine. Fine.
8621.82, Although Agent Burke repeatedly states that he is a federal agent,
8625.02, Officer Faihe continues to order him to get on the ground.
8627.98, Okay, to be fair, just because you state your federal agent doesn't necessarily mean you are, right?
8633.82, If you were trying to break into somebody's house, of course you're going to say you're a federal agent, right?
8637.82, Sorry, I'm not fucking shit dude. Wait, hold on, what was that? One second.
8663.82, A cop could instruct him to pull out his ID. I would be shocked if you were called to a house and you were told
8689.82, that it's a person impersonating a cop trying to break in. I would be shocked if you were inviting that person to reach into a pocket and pull out an ID.
8697.82, I think you would probably want to handle that. You'd probably want to secure the person first. You'd probably want to cuff him first.
8701.82, Like, let me just, we'll help you for a second. Tell me your ideas. I'll check it out. And then after that you'd like to be all clear.
8706.82, Like, if you think the person could be like a criminal with a gun trying to break in, you're not going to invite them to reach in and shit.
8712.82, But as long as they are within their jurisdiction, they can enforce every type of criminal law.
8720.82, For example, Section 737.11 of the Ohio revised code, which would apply to Officer Fahi, states that municipal police officers have the authority to enforce all municipal ordinances, as well as quote, all criminal laws of the state and the United States.
8735.82, Federal law enforcement agencies, on the other hand, have jurisdiction throughout the United States. But they typically do not have a general grant of authority to enforce all laws.
8744.82, Rather, federal law enforcement agencies are granted authority by Congress through the United States code, and most are limited to investigating matters that are within federal jurisdiction.
8753.82, While states have a general police power to pass laws for the welfare of their people, the federal government can only create laws regarding certain subjects that are listed in the constitution, such as regulating interstate commerce and providing for the police.
8764.82, The federal police are often referred to as the enumerated powers of the federal government. Therefore, both Agent Burke and Officer Fahi were operating within their jurisdiction throughout this incident.
8775.82, But without more information about the underlying situation, it is unclear whether a court would conclude that Officer Fahi's command's constituted lawful orders.
8785.82, Do you think I'm a police officer something what's the matter with you? Who do you think you are?
8800.46, My god like if this guy's like a federal agent
8802.8, I don't know how you don't instantly understand the situation right like if the cop is called and even if he's fucking up
8809.02, Even if he thinks if he thinks that you're somebody that's trying to break into a house like
8811.86, Like just why not just you do your thing fucking get on the ground
8815.58, Let him do his fucking two-minute thing and then you're done and then you walk into the light
8818.66, This is like ego be ego v ego right now. Yeah, like Jesus
8831.900000000001, Okay, I don't know if mad tips is in chat is he oh he's not here
8837.42, This is one type of police behavior that I have never understood that I don't see there ever being a rational reason for is
8846.02, Whenever you have multiple cops on a scene giving commands. I don't know why the fuck that ever happens
8851.78, I feel like there should be a very clear delineation of responsibility on the scene of any especially high like tension area
8858.58, Where like you never have like two or three or four or five cops all shouting at like the same perpetrator or victim
8864.94, Or whatever you want to call him like or suspect or whatever that yeah, that is like so brain dead to me
8871.140000000001, I don't understand and then everybody is gonna get confused and more tense and like the even if the guy's trying to act in
8875.82, Good faith we saw this happen with the
8877.82, I was gonna say with the bench shaver guy, but not even I think that was just one cop being dumbest fight, but yeah, no no
8895.619999999999, Once officer wind chill arrives on the scene agent Burke decided to comply with the commands of the officers
8900.7, What are cops where these stupid fucking bug sunglasses to I guess you probably don't want your son your eyes when you're trying to shoot somebody
8908.94, And gets on the ground while attempting to place agent Burke into handcuffs officer
8913.54, Phi he deploys his taser and after being stunned agent Burke surrenders to the officers
8920.460000000001, Just get in the car
8922.78, Why would you make us do this I didn't watch you don't want to wait no you knew it's your calm down relax
8928.54, Hey guys, please just talk to me for one second please get in the car
8933.220000000001, Sir wait, why you why you like yeah?
8936.380000000001, I like if this guy's a federal agent like why the fuck are you just like getting the cars?
8940.02, It fucking shit is what it is like it's not like you're gonna get in trouble
8942.7, You're obviously you're not breaking into a house if you you work for the ATF like just chill
8946.820000000002, Do what you need to do show them an idea and then be on your way like what the fuck what the fuck are you doing right now?
8950.58, Keep in mind that the real winner does anybody know the real winner in this situation between the cops and the ATF officer
8962.74, Yeah, the real winner was the woman who took the ATF officer shut up to take her gun
8967.74, And she's just like watching through the fucking window blinds
8971.34, She's like oh shit, dude. I'm clear. We get to keep the the glitzy. What are you calling the glitzy?
8977.62, Oh
8989.740000000002, My god, dude this guy's so I don't know if they're gonna taste them. I don't know we can show this
8993.12, And breathe let me breathe. I have a medical condition. We're gonna get air. Oh my god. Dude. I sorry. I can't say anything. Okay, get your life in get your life in we're closing this door
9004.320000000002, Sir, get your legs in. I need air
9007.28, Please call an ambulance. I'm asking for an ambulance. I'm out of cover. Oh my god. I'll do that. I don't know. Okay
9014.480000000001, I don't need the man
9016.48, The tasered and you just said call an ambulance. Yeah, no, you don't want one. Oh, I can't breathe
9023.92, This channel cuts out the violence
9027.359999999999, If you got double cars close keep the officers attempt to place agent Burke into their patrol vehicle
9032.199999999999, But he verbally and physically resists prompting the officers to force him into the back of the cruiser
9040.359999999999, The police are if you are a real police officer you ought to be ashamed of yourself
9044.2, I was trying to give you my credit. Okay to be fair though
9047.92, The the the arresting officer whatever this guy is also a little bit fucking high-strung. Okay, Jesus Christ. All right
9057.52, But also the guy being arrested is
9065.560000000001, Federal officers in this fucking country. Holy shit
9068.66, It's like I'm watching like a it's like somebody's like an oblivion engine and turn the AI up to like ultra aggro on like all the
9074.64, Parties and they're just like screaming random shit at each other
9088.46, How much time you have to train for to be police and the US isn't like a fucking 12 week program or some shit
9093.24, I think it's sweet and you have to go to school for four or five years to do it
9096.04, But I'm pretty sure in the US I feel like it's like a four. It's like a three or four month program, isn't it?
9100.080000000002, I might be wrong on that. I
9102.800000000001, Actually, let's look that up cuz I hear that repeated that might be sure how long training to become
9108.04, police officer
9112.6, California is probably gonna be like the most of my guess the duration of the training and the police Academy various for different agencies
9118.0, Usually takes about 13 to 19 weeks on average, but Ken last up to six months
9133.24, That's what we thought but then he wouldn't get in the car if he is an actual police officer. He got to be ashamed of himself
9140.88, You're not you're right you're not yeah
9144.08, No
9147.4, No, you screwed up you bet
9150.48, Happening here. I think he should have had as bad as that when I got here wouldn't get on the ground wouldn't comply with anything
9157.84, Whoever whenever the sergeant gets here will call his supervisor
9162.48, Disappoint he's still shouting from the car. What is happening? It was he went to win? Why?
9168.68, No, you never know it's all on video
9180.24, Yeah, we had to use the taser just a drive stun, okay, but he's got a medic
9184.32, He says he's got some condition. He may even really be a police officer
9187.68, He's got a badge, but he wouldn't do anything wouldn't get on the ground. I told him over and over together
9192.4, He wouldn't comply with anything. We had to tase him. He followed us the whole time
9195.96, When getting the car if he is a real police officer
9200.64, No, we're not okay
9203.039999999999, Yeah, right yeah
9205.919999999998, So his supervisor is gonna need to come to see
9208.8, After the way he acted bro, this guy going to Sigma grind set, okay be a cop get arrested by cops
9215.28, Sit in a cop car be on the clock the entire time if that's not Sigma shit, okay. I don't know what the fuck is
9237.04, Look at him dude. He's chilling back there. He doesn't give a fuck. He remarked and he said over and over
9241.36, I'm not getting on the ground. I will not I said you know you obviously don't know what's going on there
9247.52, If he's here to work or worry by himself, there's something strange about that too
9251.76, That actually is true. Oh, that's actually super true
9258.560000000001, That actually that might be the sketchiest thing of all wait
9261.960000000001, Where are there any do I have federal agents in my chat?
9264.36, You're you're a sent to a house to retrieve a firearm from somebody that's not supposed to have one if
9269.0, If you were a police officer, I don't think you're ever running that solo
9273.64, But do federal agents do like solo pickups like that that that actually might be the sketchiest thing of all if you showed up
9281.04, And there are like two there are like two people at the door
9283.6, It's like but if there's one guy you're an officer
9285.88, What are you here for to get a gun that yeah in plain clothes like that's probably actually the weirdest thing in the world
9290.76, That makes this thing like so strange. I watch these channels a lot supposedly you call local sheriff such cops whose sister from what I've seen
9298.92, Is that though aren't federal agents commonly single for low risk warrant?
9301.84, I don't know if it's a little risk or not all I know the only piece of information
9304.6, I know is he was sent to a house to retrieve a firearm somebody that's not supposed to have one
9309.76, So if they're not supposed to have a firearm, I mean, what is this they've been convicted for a felony
9315.4, They've been convicted for what domestic violence
9318.12, um
9319.480000000001, Might have a restraining order that might prohibit firearm. I'm not sure like what like
9323.92, It's not it's like I don't know that that seems really weird that you would run that alone, but maybe for federal agents
9330.12, Maybe it's not sure
9332.560000000001, Even what even when I've had the FBI come to my house to ask me questions even for FBI
9337.0, It's always two people there's always two people that show up
9339.52, But yeah, I don't know that's super weird
9354.04, Here the Columbus officers remark that agent Burke was allegedly at the location to follow up on the purchase of a shotgun
9360.720000000001, Okay, hold on so Tim in chat says this happens all the time for example when you file for a firearm stamp or such and get rejected
9367.72, Then the ATF may come to pick up the firearm. You try to get a stamp for okay. I might be
9373.72, Which is a common task for an ATF agent the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives known as the
9380.439999999999, ATF for short is a law enforcement agency within the Department of Justice that according to section 599A of title 28 of the US Code is
9388.679999999998, Responsible for investigating quote criminal and regulatory violations of the federal firearms explosives
9394.16, arson alcohol and tobacco smuggling laws under section 30 51 of title 18 of the US Code
9400.32, ATF agents have the authority to quote make seizures of property subject to forfeiture to the United States
9405.92, Which according to section 924 of title 18 of the US Code includes
9410.48, illegally possessed firearms in fact as the Wall Street Journal reported in 2019
9415.039999999999, ATF agents are regularly involved in retrieving weapons from individuals who were sold firearms when they should have not been permitted to purchase one
9422.24, Due to their background check these delayed denials occur when because of backlogs in the federal background check system
9428.96, Individuals are sold firearms before their background check is completed as the sale is legally permitted to proceed after three business days
9436.0, Even if the check is not finished if the FBI which performs the background checks determines that an individual should not have been sold a firearm
9442.96, Once the check is completed the delayed denial is referred to the ATF to track down and seize the weapon in 2017 alone
9449.76, The ATF was responsible for handling about 6,000 of these seizures and a delayed denial is only one of the reasons that an ATF agent can
9457.44, confiscate weapons while it is uncertain whether agent Burke was pursuing a delayed denial or was following up on another firearm issue
9463.92, It is clear that agent Burke was performing a routine duty in his role as an ATF special agent
9470.4, Are you guys the ones that originally called
9473.28, Okay, what what did he say to you when he's talking to you?
9475.52, I have to open the door because he's a police. I tell him I can't open the door because my husband
9482.48, He said you have to open the door. I tell him I'm sorry. I can't stay with my kids. My kids are crying because they afraid
9490.800000000001, I tell him did he ever try to did he ever try and break the door anything like that?
9494.800000000001, Yes, he is so knock on he said I will stay here until evening if you don't open the door because you have a layer
9500.32, Okay, very good. There's a chance to charge him. I want to talk to you. So thank you very much. Okay
9506.4, Great the cop slash agent and see how your grade compares to the video grade at the end
9511.119999999999, Um, I mean like the cops that showed up
9514.16, They were being called theoretically high risk
9515.76, But it feels like they were way too on edge like especially the second guy that showed up and started screaming
9520.96, So like I don't know the cops just showed up. It feels like they could have been more chill
9524.32, I'll give them a see I guess I'll give them a see
9527.119999999999, I'm not I'm not impressed with how they showed up and handled things
9529.36, Um for the ATF officer, um, I give him an f anytime
9535.92, It's so the way that I look at this, um and get mad if you want
9539.92, Anytime you are refusing orders
9542.32, Lawful orders from an officer you're I'm almost always going to say you're in the wrong
9545.6, Even if the officers have a good reason to ask it like you're just especially you should know better as a federal agent
9550.0, Like you're just asking for shit to get escalated to such an unimaginable level. Why would you do that?
9555.12, If somebody's telling you like hey, I'm a cop get the fuck down. I'm just like, all right. Yeah, fuck it
9558.32, I'll get down right. I think it's bullshit, but like I'm not gonna argue with you and as a federal agent you should know better
9563.039999999999, Uh, yeah, so I give the ATF guy an f but that's that's where the cops just showed up on the scene
9568.0, I'll give them a see maybe a c minus for being so hot headed and intense right off the bat
9573.039999999999, um
9574.8, but the um
9578.0, Uh the ATF guy is yeah, it's a big fat f
9584.08, Check your youtube thing. Oh, shit
9586.08, I
9588.08, Changed it. There you go
9601.28, The complainant essentially admits to the Columbus officers that she refused to open the door for agent berk despite the fact that she was informed
9608.24, That he was a federal officer in general citizens are under no obligation to open their doors to members of law enforcement without a warrant
9614.8, And this remains true in this situation
9617.039999999999, Although agent berk was at the home to retrieve a shotgun from a citizen who was not legally allowed to own a firearm
9622.56, It is likely that a court would conclude that the citizen did not have to open the door or surrender the firearm if agent berk did not have a warrant
9630.0, In the 1958 case of jones versus united states the supreme court explained that quote
9634.64, It is settled doctrine that probable cause for belief that certain
9637.92, Article subject to seizure are in a dwelling cannot of itself justify a search without a warrant were federal officers free to search without a warrant
9646.0, merely upon probable cause to believe that certain articles were within a home the provisions of the fourth amendment would become empty phrases
9652.8, And the protection it affords largely nullified similarly in the 1980 case of paton versus new york
9658.24, The supreme court stated that quote it is a basic principle of fourth amendment law that searches and seizures inside a home without a warrant
9664.72, Are presumptively unreasonable. So we can't tell the woman could be super manipulative or crazy
9670.8, But she appears she appears to be relatively sane and sober at the door
9676.72, That's the appearance that she gives
9678.96, Which makes me wonder what was this atf agent doing at the door that actually prompted her to call the local police
9686.88, Um, i'm super curious about that
9690.24, It seems now this is all congestion
9692.4, It seems unlikely to me that the atf agent just knocked and said hello i'm here to retrieve a firearm
9698.4, It's i don't know if there was like a fight at the door where he was like i'm coming in number with a fucker
9703.039999999999, Like he was like pounding or some shit and she felt they need to call 911
9706.08, Um, i'm really curious about that
9709.44, um
9710.96, But i don't know maybe maybe she did just call the police to get him thrown out or some shit like yeah, i'm not sure
9715.12, There are absent exigent circumstances a warrantless entry to search for weapons or contraband is unconstitutional
9722.0, Even when a felony has been committed and there is probable cause to believe that incriminating evidence will be found within
9727.2, While it is certainly possible that in some situations
9730.160000000002, Exigent circumstances to enter home and seize an illegal firearm without a warrant banging on the door
9734.640000000001, People ain't saying he wouldn't be leaving he'll wait till her husband gets to that
9737.12, So she said yeah, but like that doesn't say anything to me right because it could literally be like
9741.44, Like bang i'm gonna wait here. You're god damn fucking i just make it something right
9744.32, It could be that or it could be like, you know, nag, talking about you're not gonna let me in you're like, okay
9747.6, I'm gonna wait right here until your husband gets back right i'll be back i'm gonna have a cigarette
9750.4, Right like those two situations it could be the same thing, but they're totally different
9754.64, Right, that's what i'm saying right it could
9755.84, They could act those could be those two things could be totally different in how they play out, you know
9759.52, Or it may exist there did not appear to be any such emergency in this situation
9763.92, Assuming that agent berk was not executing a warrant the complainant was most likely within her rights to refuse to answer the door for agent berk
9778.16, What's he got?
9784.0, There's a chance he may even be a religion
9786.64, He grabbed the handle. Yeah, yeah, they said it would put it out of an eight that he's trying to break in
9790.56, That's why i thought he's working to 58 by himself. Yeah, yeah after holding agent berk for about an hour
9795.439999999999, The officers released him without charges on december 4th 2020 agent berk filed a federal lawsuit against the city of columbus
9802.32, Officer by he and officer winchill alleging that among other violations officers by he and winchill used excessive force during the incident
9809.84, According to the complaint agent berk was transferred to an administrative support role within atf after the incident because of the injuries he suffered
9816.64, As of the date of this episode the lawsuit is still pending overall agent berk gets a c minus
9822.4, Oh shit. He was likely acting i wrote it. No, no wait, which one is agent berk? Is that agent berk?
9827.84, Then his lawful authority when the columbus officers arrived on the scene he refused to obey what were likely lawful orders from the
9834.64, Oh, no, never mind. I gave that guy an f this never mind. We're we're probably gonna have our great switched fuck
9839.12, officers physically and verbally resisted the officers and maintained an unprofessional and condescending demeanor throughout the encounter
9846.640000000001, While it is clear from the video footage that agent berk informed the columbus officers that he was a federal agent on multiple occasions
9852.800000000001, That statement alone does not override the officer's authority. Yeah, wait that statement alone to be clear
9857.84, That statement alone is meaningless. Who the fuck bro? I'm a fed. I promise chill man. I'm chill bro. I'm a fed like who can't yeah
9865.52, Yeah, you order him to the ground until they can secure the scene
9869.44, Agent berk was armed at the time of the encounter and it could certainly be argued that the columbus officers just wanted to disarm him in case
9876.4, He was in fact pretending to be a federal agent if agent berk had politely complied with the orders of the officers instead of blatantly
9883.84, Refusing to get on the ground then this interaction may have had a much different outcome true
9887.92, All that said there is no denying that at least some degree of negligence took place from the columbus officers conduct
9893.68, But agent berk may have had a much stronger case against them if he had been more willing to cooperate with their commands
9899.12, I commend the agent for following up this interaction with the proper legal actions
9903.12, But I would caution him to consider the notion that federal law enforcement authority does not trump state law enforcement authority in future encounters
9911.68, The columbus officers get an f for approaching the scene with their weapons drawn despite no immediate threat being present
9918.16, Neglecting to consider the facts of the encounter in an effort to gain control of the situation and for failing to conduct a legitimate
9924.64, Investigation into agent berk's identity before deciding to place him under arrest although the legality of the columbus officer wait
9930.16, Hold on. Oh my god. I disagree with so much of this. Fuck. Hold on. Wait a second
9934.4, Where is peace go?
9936.72, The police officers didn't actually arrest him did they?
9940.56, I thought that it wouldn't that have just been a detainment while they performed an investigation to verify his identity
9945.84, And then he was released. I don't do they actually would would you consider this? What is the I didn't see the video? Oh fuck
9953.04, I don't know if this would be considered like an arrest or if this would be considered like what is it?
9957.04, What is the difference between like an arrest and a detainment like?
9961.12, Somebody you're you're so I'll just I'll tell you basically what happened, right?
9964.4, So these guys get a call that somebody is impersonating a federal officer trying to break into a house
9970.64, So they show up at the scene of crime
9972.64, What about it? Oh shit. Okay. Ready?
9977.039999999999, You don't your question. Okay. Am I watching? No, I'm just I'll tell you. I'm gonna watch okay
9980.88, So these so please obviously get a call
9983.519999999999, That there's a suspicious man that is
9986.0, Impersonating a federal officer trying to break into a house. Okay lady calls with her kids
9990.32, So officers show up to the scene
9992.48, Basically guns drawn if not immediately then almost immediately when they see the guy at the door
9996.48, They shouted him for a while to get down. They have a verbal scuffle or whatever and then eventually they
10000.96, They get him to the ground. They hand cuffed him and they put him in the back of the car
10005.199999999999, While they call for backup backup comes they perform an investigation
10008.4, They go through his idea or whatever they they get witness statements on the lady
10011.359999999999, Whatever and then after holding him for about an hour. They let him go
10014.96, Is this considered an arrest or a detainment?
10017.839999999998, So
10019.039999999999, First of all, I just passed the bar, but I don't know if I can call us the whole lawyers yet. Okay
10024.72, Congratulations, by the way
10026.72, I get people really want me to say this during the altercation they tase him as well. We're good. Okay
10032.56, That actually might be relevant for
10036.0, Determinate whether or not it's arrest. Okay. Um, I will say for constitutional purposes
10041.199999999999, A seizure probably occurred
10044.32, So
10045.359999999999, There are things known as terry stops
10048.08, Where essentially you're being quote detained and for constitutional purposes
10052.48, Uh, if you've heard of stopping frisk, so that policy
10056.8, Constitutionally is referred to as a seizure now the distinction between
10061.119999999999, Unarrest and like a detainment or something like that. Uh, typically has to do with like
10066.16, Um, whether or not you are brought to another station
10070.56, Whether or not it's for an absurd amount of like a long amount of time
10074.8, And um, so those distinctions the more it starts to look
10077.84, Like you're being placed someplace different you're being detained for a long period of time
10083.36, Sure, um, if you ever brought to booking or something, of course, I would consider that an arrest. Absolutely
10087.84, Right, but if you're a hey if you're like held at the scene while they perform an investigation to verify something you said
10092.64, You haven't been formally charged with a crime or they don't even really have like
10095.76, Probable causes spectrum of a crime. It seems weird to call that at a rest
10099.44, Right. So standard there for a terry stop or a tayman
10102.96, Uh, typically is reasonable suspicion and that's a lower threshold of evidence that
10108.64, Then probable cause of that that difference in threshold actually matters sometimes
10112.96, And so if you are stopping someone for questioning you don't have probable cause they committed a crime or anything
10117.679999999998, So you cannot, uh, you know remove them from their situation and detain them for a long period of time and do everything else
10123.839999999998, That's the total of the full rest
10125.359999999999, Also to be clear for a terry stop reasonable suspicion can be as much as you match a description
10132.08, A somewhat accurate description like given like a call to the police, right?
10135.68, It's a lower standard
10136.8, So that actually is case law on like can it be an anonymous tip?
10141.28, Uh sufficient for for a terry stop and um, I'm not read up on the latest
10146.56, Uh about what is sufficient for reasonable suspicion. It certainly is
10149.76, Less than probable cause it could be something like, um
10154.0, You know, maybe furtive movements plus something else or maybe like, uh
10158.8, There's some articulable reason that's points to a particular person
10164.88, Um that gives you a reason to stop them
10166.88, So if it can't just be like, well, he was in a crowd of a bunch of people
10171.92, And it's kind of a
10173.279999999999, Unambiguate, un- this inviguated kind of situation it has to be kind of articulable
10179.119999999999, Suspicions towards a particular person kind of deal it is like
10182.88, Like not the most clear kind of thing all the time and there are edge cases
10189.119999999999, But if there's like someone who's saying
10191.679999999998, If you have a witness who's not anonymous saying I think this person has a gun
10195.92, I think typically that would be like
10197.679999999998, You're easily at the level of like performing a terry stop at a detainment, right?
10201.199999999999, Yes, yeah, especially because that has a lot of indicia of credibility
10206.56, And it's you know, particularize an individual that's I would say in most cases that's going to be okay
10211.28, Under federal constitutional now keep in mind a lot of states have their own thresholds
10217.76, That they have that you have to follow so in the state of New York
10221.04, You have to have basis for even approaching someone
10224.400000000001, Which is it's a lower thing than reasonable suspicion
10226.960000000001, So there's other law that you might have to deal with other than federal constitutional law
10231.52, Although that's kind of like the main thing that we're dealing with in these in these situations
10234.800000000001, Gotcha. Do you think in this case then based on what I told you?
10237.12, Does this sound like an arrest or detainment?
10239.12, A tasing of someone and holding them for an hour in a police car
10246.720000000001, For me, I think there's a strong argument that's that's like an arrest if you
10251.44, You physically restrain them with a taser you've held them for over an hour
10256.400000000001, Why does so why does the use of force matter here?
10259.92, Because because I think that that has indicia of
10261.68, I'm like a full formal arrest. I would say well so like so here so here's a question because theoretically
10269.52, Every single detainment is going to be done up to lethal force. You're right you agree with that right?
10274.08, Uh
10275.12, Imprencial yeah, yeah, so are you telling me that something that could be a detainment
10280.24, If you resist enough it will just turn into an arrest as a result of that
10284.08, For constitutional purposes. I'm not sure
10286.08, Listen, I'm not too sure well because like let's say that I give you this exact same thing except
10290.0, They don't taste them. They just bring them in does that now instead of an arrest now it turns into a detainment?
10293.36, It seems weird that it would depend on our I think the hours kind of like
10298.0, Looming large in my head although I think that there have been
10301.2, Terry stops that have been more than an hour. It's just kind of a totality of circumstances test
10306.64, I think it's from what you've told me
10309.76, I don't know what's the significance of whether or not it's arrest versus a
10312.88, Terry stop
10314.32, Oh, I just I once he said he gave so the verbiage that this guy used in the video was he was upset because the cops
10320.32, I think he says only the cops arrested him for no reason
10322.64, But I didn't think he it didn't come off to me like they arrested him for no reason
10325.92, It seemed like reasonable that they detained a man that was reported for
10329.44, Impersonating a federal officer trying to break in who was resisting lawful orders
10333.199999999999, So they detain him for an hour. They verified his identity and then they let him leave
10336.4, So I don't know if he's resisting then I wouldn't you have probable cause to arrest him for resisting arrest
10342.16, Um
10344.16, Yeah, but I don't think he was I don't think it was ever like no no that that is true
10348.32, But I don't think he was charged with resisting arrest or anything like that, right?
10351.44, Okay, well who cares if they're charged or not?
10354.4, just because
10355.52, You know the whatever attorney doesn't decide to press charges or doesn't then decide to
10360.56, You know criminally prosecute them. That's kind of not what we're analyzing
10364.88, What's the significance of this in general? I guess like is there a civil case going on or something?
10369.92, Um, I don't know. I think so. I think he filed civil
10373.44, Charges or he went through some federal legal or might be a federal casey, but I don't remember
10376.960000000001, But he filed some kind of charges against the police department. Yeah, so what are you upset about or
10382.32, I'm not upset. Damn. I'm just watching a fucking video. Okay
10385.52, Um
10386.64, No, I was just curious in terms of like what would count as to do and just be like an arrest versus like a detainment or whatever
10391.6, I can sure I'm
10392.56, I'm
10393.44, Give me give me like 10 seconds. I may just listen to his verbiage again and I'll see what
10396.56, Hold on their weapons drawn despite no immediate threat being present
10399.68, Neglecting to consider the facts of the encounter in an effort to gain control of the situation and for failing to conduct a legitimate
10403.84, Investigation into agent perks identity before deciding to place them under arrest although the legality of the club saw
10407.68, So they said for failing to conduct a legitimate investigation of his identity before placing him under arrest
10412.88, But it seemed like arresting him or at least attaining him was like a pretty necessary part of performing that investigation
10417.76, Since he wouldn't comply with the officer's commands to get down on the ground when they showed up at the door
10421.68, But oh and so they're graded them poorly because it didn't ask for his name
10425.12, Well, I I guess that um, fuck do you want to just watch the interaction?
10432.640000000001, Lagging um yeah, I guess so yeah
10436.08, Um, okay. I'm just gonna go to 130. We're gonna have two exes bitch, right?
10440.320000000002, Okay, but did you did you send it to me or
10444.560000000001, You just watch my do you want me to send it to you? I can send it to you
10446.56, Is
10453.039999999999, Or actually if I get just put it on one x I have 25 minutes
10456.64, No, no put it on 1.5. Okay, and then we'll just we'll talk through this together. We'll go through together. Okay, ready?
10460.8, All right, one point five at 20 minutes. No, I'm at one minute and 30 seconds
10466.08, Yeah, at 1.5 times speed
10469.439999999999, One second, I'll tell you one
10472.64, Okay, let me know when you're ready
10474.64, All right, two one go 20 ATF agent James Burke went to a home in Columbus, Ohio to retrieve a weapon from an individual
10481.119999999999, Who was not permitted to have firearm?
10482.32, Agent Burke knocked on the door
10483.279999999999, But the individual inside the home refused to open it and called 911 instead despite the fact that the caller read the dispatcher agent
10488.18, Burke's badge number officers Joseph Feihy and Kevin Winkle of the Columbus Division of Police were dispatched to investigate the situation as an attempted break-in
10493.599999999999, Hey turn around. Let me see your hands turn around. Let me see your hands. Okay. Let me see your hands
10497.439999999999, I need to see some ID get on the ground get on the ground now get on the ground
10503.039999999999, Get on the ground now
10504.56, Federal agent 917123
10506.88, Get on the ground
10509.359999999999, Why wouldn't you show me your ID when I got here don't move forward?
10513.92, Get on the ground figure it out
10517.92, Well the state we're at
10519.92, Why do you got to make this harder than it is?
10522.32, I have no problem making this
10527.279999999999, I'm not ever reacting. We got to call the someone's a person in a police officer out here done have ID
10530.56, No kidding because she doesn't want to okay get on the ground so I can find out who you are
10534.4, Okay fine fine
10535.6, Although agent Burke repeatedly states that he is a federal agent officer
10538.16, Phi he continues to order him to get on the ground while the interplay between the jurisdiction okay stop right here
10541.92, I don't care about this. Okay, so I feel like that commentary is really silly
10546.16, So if you get a call that somebody isn't personing a federal agent and trying to break into your house
10550.72, And then you show up on the scene of the crime and the guy's like I'm a fed don't shoot
10553.519999999999, I mean like if he is in person a federal agent. He's obviously gonna say that right
10556.56, Yeah, I would totally agree with that
10559.68, Yeah, it seems like at this point whether the whether the cops are in the right or the wrong or whether whatever
10564.88, It's my my view on dealing with police is that like if you're being given orders
10570.8, Even if you think they're in the wrong you have to comply unless you feel like your life is at risk or something
10575.199999999999, And that like like refusal or failure to comply. There's just no excuse for it, especially if you're another federal agent like why would you ever do that?
10581.84, It just seems total. I mean they're there to investigate
10584.72, I
10585.679999999998, Would hope that the cops would communicate it that they're to investigate a impersonator which he said he said we're here to investigate a break
10591.84, Yeah, the cops said we're here. We were called here to investigate a potential breaking maybe a federal impersonator
10595.76, I don't know if he said but he said potential breaking at least yeah, okay. Yeah, I think that
10600.56, just like
10601.76, regular people should comply with
10604.16, orders of the cops
10606.88, Especially in those circumstances where we have I think that you showed a video before where there was like
10612.16, Actually people impersonating
10615.2, Of the police. Oh the two people at the front door where they were trying to say yeah
10618.88, And there was like a video from whatever the the hardware is that gives you the doorbell
10623.84, video whatever
10624.96, I'm so I think I tend to agree with you that you need to be able to verify who you are
10629.6, That's why they have badges and that's why I mean
10632.56, Okay, all right. We're gonna keep I'm at 305
10634.56, Um, we don't need to listen to like all the case law bullshit or whatever. Okay. I'm gonna go ahead to 415. Okay. Let me know when you're ready
10644.64, All right ready three two one go
10647.519999999999, So such as regulating interstate commerce and providing for the punishment of counterfeiting money
10650.8, These powers are often referred to as the enumerated powers of the federal government
10653.6, Therefore both agent Burke and officer Fehe were operating within their jurisdiction throughout this incident
10657.2, But without more information about the underlying situation it is unclear whether a court would conclude that obseur phi he's commands constituted lawful orders
10665.12, What's the matter with you? Who do you think you are?
10667.12, I'm not gonna fall off. I got my eyes to not be your waist keep your hands up
10676.0, Get on the ground. Face down now. Face down
10681.44, Face down all the way now all the way
10683.36, Once officer wind chill arrives on the scene
10684.720000000001, Agent Burke decides to comply with the commands of the officers and gets on the ground while attempting to place agent Burke into handcuffs officer
10689.44, Phi he deploys his taser and after being stunned agent Burke surrenders to the officers
10694.160000000002, Just get in the car
10695.76, Why would you make us do this? I didn't watch you. I wanted it. No, you knew it sure
10699.2, Relax, hey guys, please just talk to me for one second. Please get in the car. We'll talk later. Sir. Wait. Wait. I had your chance
10704.0, No, I was trying to give you my credit. You didn't let me show up to everyone's right. I did get in the car. Wait now
10709.12, I gotta breathe. Okay, so let me breathe. I have a medical condition. We're gonna get air to you. Get your left in. Get your left in. We're closing the store
10714.880000000001, Sir, get your left in. I need air. Sir, please call me. I'm asking for an ambulance. I'm asking for an ambulance. Get the car
10719.36, Sir, I don't need to make the taser in the house. I don't know you don't want one
10723.28, Get over the car. You're sorry. I can't breathe. Wait, sir
10728.08, If you got double cars close, keep me the officers attempt to place agent Burke into their patrol vehicle
10731.2, But he verbally and physically resists prompting the officers to force him into the back of the cruiser
10736.800000000001, Please sir. If you are a real police officer, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. I'm trying to get in my credit
10740.880000000001, We got him in the car. He might need to be a real car, but he wouldn't do anything. We get on the ground. I mean what they got?
10746.800000000001, You bet. We had to take his room. We got a dramatic coming
10750.0, We got him in the car. We got him in the car. We got him in the car. We got him in the car.
10753.6, We got him in the car. If he is an actual police officer, he ought to be ashamed of himself.
10757.12, You're not. You're right. You're not. Yeah
10761.44, No, you screwed up. You bet. Oh, and he is a bad issue. First thing he should have had his badge is that when I got here
10765.76, Wouldn't get on the ground. Wouldn't comply with anything.
10768.24, Whoever the sergeant gets here will call his supervisor.
10770.88, Yep. At this point. Dude, you saw how he was. He wouldn't be winning. Why?
10776.32, No, you never know. It's all in video.
10778.32, Just let him yell.
10781.119999999999, Yeah, we had to use the taser. It just drives down.
10782.56, Okay. But he's got a medic. He says he's got some condition.
10784.64, He may even really be a police officer. He's got a badge, but he wouldn't do anything.
10787.76, He wouldn't go on the ground. I told him over and over and over again. He wouldn't comply with anything.
10790.0, We had to tase him. He fought with us the whole time.
10792.16, Wouldn't get in the car. If he is a real police officer.
10794.32, Anything? No, we're not. Okay. Okay.
10796.32, All right. Yeah. So his supervisor is going to need to come to see.
10799.6, That's the way he acted. It's all in video.
10801.279999999999, He's got a good look at it. He very well may be.
10803.92, But you know what? When a Columbus police officer? Yeah.
10805.44, You're good. You're good. I know.
10808.880000000001, He remarked it. He said over and over. I'm not getting on the ground. I will not.
10811.52, What? Good. That's not the only one.
10812.720000000001, I said, you know, you obviously don't know what's going on then.
10814.4, If he's here to work a war by himself, there's something strange about that too.
10817.12, I got you for like her husband bought a shotgun or something.
10819.68, He was here to follow up on some shotgun purchase. Yeah.
10823.12, Who knows?
10823.68, Here, the Columbus officers remarked that Agent Burke was allegedly at the location
10826.480000000001, to follow up on the purchase of a shotgun, which is a common task for an ATF agent.
10829.2, The Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms Explosives, known as the ATF, for short,
10832.880000000001, is a law enforcement agency within the Department of Justice that,
10834.96, according to Section 599A of Title 48. Okay. We can pause for a second.
10838.64, Let's get. We don't need all this.
10841.599999999999, So basically he's in the car now while they're either call a supervisor or they're trying to
10846.56, verify his identity. I think they might search the car or they're just going through the
10850.32, badger whatever on the ground. I think to verify that federal credentials.
10853.519999999999, I'm at 10-10 right now. Okay. One second.
10859.119999999999, You're at 1.5 speed, right? Yep.
10861.04, Yep. Three, two, one. Go.
10864.240000000002, Either Agent Burke was pursuing a delayed denial or it was following up on another firearm issue.
10867.36, It is clear that Agent Burke was performing a routine duty in his role as an ATF special agent.
10870.560000000001, I know what all rights are.
10871.68, Are you guys the ones that originally called?
10873.44, Okay. What did he say to you when he was talking to you?
10875.12, I have to open the door because he's a police. I tell him I can't open the door because my husband...
10878.320000000002, Props on the edge from your family.
10879.52, You have to open the door. I tell him I'm sorry I can't stay with my kids.
10882.880000000001, My kids start crying because they have to leave.
10884.400000000001, Do you have a warrant?
10885.2, Okay. No.
10885.92, You ever tried to do the ever...
10886.960000000001, Oh.
10888.0, I'm going to pause for one moment.
10893.84, Okay.
10894.64, Ten.
10895.04, So now I'm being honest. I'm making a lot of assumptions here that this lady is not like
10900.48, crazy manipulative or whatever because she could be, right?
10902.72, But assuming everything she's saying is like relatively truthful and she looks to be pretty
10906.16, like saying pretty sober, pretty in control of her kids don't seem like you're saying right?
10910.24, Sounds like an okay police call. If her husband's not home, some cultures you know she doesn't
10914.56, want to open the door for somebody like this and he's like banging the door saying I'm going to stay
10918.16, here until he comes or whatever. I think that the call is probably okay especially if he doesn't
10922.16, have a warrant or anything. He can't force anything.
10923.279999999999, You have to have a warrant.
10924.08, Yeah. I mean I think that I would probably open the door and talk to them but I don't have a
10930.32, problem with them not opening the door if there's no warrant.
10933.519999999999, Sure. Especially small woman. It was a big guy. I don't know if he's not like...
10936.4, So I'm sympathetic to the police call. Okay. So I'm at 1054. You ready to go?
10941.279999999999, Yeah. That's Rob.
10942.16, Okay. Three, two, one, go.
10944.48, So thank you very much. Okay. Good. Thank you.
10948.08, The complainant essentially admits to the Columbus officers that she refused to open the
10950.64, door for Agent Burke despite the fact that she was informed that he was a federal officer.
10953.68, In general citizens are under no obligation to open their doors to members of law enforcement
10956.72, at a warrant. Yeah. Okay. And then stop here. And then again like he keeps bringing that up but like I
10960.56, mean like I admitted that I didn't open the door when he said he was a fed like well sure but I
10964.72, mean like it sounds like it's because she wants her husband to home and also yeah I don't know the
10968.16, situation of these people with their lives are like like there might be yeah who cares if somebody
10971.04, says it and I'm at a 1225. All right. Three, two, one, go. To be any such emergency in this situation.
10980.960000000001, Assuming that Agent Burke was not executing a warrant the complainant was most likely within
10984.0, her rights to refuse the answer to the door for Agent Burke.
10985.68, I agree with that.
10990.400000000001, What's he going?
10994.320000000002, There's a chance he may even be a legitimate person.
10995.68, She's a thing around the hand in general.
10997.12, Yeah. They say we put it as an eight but he's trying to break it.
10998.72, That's why I thought he was working to be able to get by himself.
11000.64, After holding Agent Burke for about an hour the officers released him without charges.
11003.279999999999, On December 4th 2020, Agent Burke filed a federal lawsuit against the city of Columbus,
11006.48, Officer Feihy and Officer Wenchill alleging that among other violations officers Feihy and Wenchill
11010.0, are using excessive force during the incident. According to the complaint Agent Burke was
11012.64, transferred to administrative support. Oh yeah so they might not be able to sue but they might
11016.08, be able to file a complaint or something.
11022.16, What?
11024.24, I guess I'm still sitting. Oh shit I paused it sorry I paused it.
11026.48, Oh yeah okay. Yeah I don't know why so there's a
11033.92, would qualify would state qualified immunity be like preempted by federal law or something like
11041.84, that. I'm wondering so there's a supremacy clause to the Constitution makes it so that like
11046.96, federal law trumps state law. I'm wondering if you can use qualified immunity to protect yourself
11053.68, from lawsuits from like federal actors in their official capacity. I guess he's suing his individual
11061.68, capacity. Well I think the so madtips and shaddies of police did it. This sounds right. I think
11065.84, that qualified immunity just means that as an individual you can't be sued right but the agency
11070.960000000001, still can right. Oh weren't they suing the cops or were they suing the agency?
11074.960000000001, I think it was a complaint against the Columbus Police Department is what I think it was.
11078.16, Okay that's interesting. What's the what's the complaint say what's the substance do we know?
11083.84, I think it was like on on on do force or something what do you call it or obsessive not
11089.76, obsessive. Excessive force or whatever yeah. Well like a section 1983 claim that they violated the
11098.16, the federal officers like civil rights or something. Maybe something like that.
11101.119999999999, There's a rereading the complaint but sorry. Well we can go back to if you want go to 13 minutes
11106.72, and put it at times one and we can just listen for the exact complaint okay. Okay three two
11117.359999999999, was released him without charges. On December 4th 2020,
11120.64, Agent Burke filed a federal lawsuit against the city of Columbus,
11123.76, Officer Feihy and Officer Wenchill alleging that among other violations,
11127.519999999999, officers Feihy and Wenchill used excessive force. Wait hold on wait wait stop.
11131.12, Pause for a sec. Yeah but okay sorry. Fuck I didn't listen to start but it's he's filing a complaint not like a civil case right these are different things or.
11137.92, No it is a civil case. He'll complain to you. A civil complaint would be like a lawsuit.
11142.160000000002, Oh gotcha gotcha. Okay gotcha. I'm at 13 or 13 or 13 or 14. Okay three two one go.
11148.960000000001, According to the complaint, Agent Burke was transferred to an administrative support role within ATF after
11153.68, the incident because of the injuries he suffered. As of the date of this episode, the lawsuit is
11158.0, still pending. Overall Agent Burke gets a C minus because. Oh shit fuck I was gonna ask you for your grades on these.
11164.48, Don't be tainted. I'm curious. So if you have to grade on an A plus to F scale,
11170.48, the federal agent and then the police officers, what would you what would you grade each of them?
11174.48, Starting with the I guess with the federal agent.
11176.72, F's both both F's I think. I think the I really I always have like a defense oriented mind and so.
11188.32, You know sometimes I feel weird about officers going to to house without warrants to try to like
11193.279999999999, get consent to like do searches and all that kind of stuff from from people and plus from like a
11199.119999999999, practical perspective the federal officer wasn't was being kind of silly and just not listening and
11205.04, um compliant. I don't think that I think the state officers are like exaggerating the extent to
11210.240000000002, which he didn't comply with their orders but he didn't comply in some substantive ways like
11215.76, getting on the ground after multiple times being told and that just seemed really stupid and led
11221.28, to his his tasing. The other the state cops were absolutely nuts to treat him the way they did
11229.68, after they had arrested him and like just shoving him in the in the door. I mean that just seemed
11234.0, totally unnecessary after they had had him under control on the top of the door way to
11240.24, aggro initially. Yeah. So I would give it probably F's to vote. Okay. I absolutely gave an F to the
11246.48, federal officer because I don't know why you're non-compliant at the door. I don't know what you
11249.52, ever expect to happen at that point other than somebody's either going to die or you're going to
11252.8, get you know fucked up. Yeah it makes no sense to me. Yeah I gave the police officers a C minus
11258.8, because the attitude was fucking horrible. They seemed both like really really really hot.
11263.2, I don't think they technically did anything completely legal and I could be empathetic in some
11267.36, situation where like if you're getting a call for a suspected break in and you're like it's
11270.720000000001, like it's like the equivalent like swatting somebody like cops show up in the early hot head because
11274.16, they've heard some crazy shit but I think they probably could have been a bit more chilled out
11277.36, handling the handling the situation for sure. Here's a question that I have for you. I have never
11283.28, understood this. I feel like there is never a oh and Matt tips is here now so I can ask the
11287.6, question as well. I feel like there is never a good reason for police officers on the scene
11293.12, to have more than one person giving instructions. I don't know why the fuck that is the case or
11298.480000000001, the thing ever. Why? I think we're thinking about it like multiple times that where it's been caught
11302.480000000001, on camera that there's conflicting equal and opposite directions like either get on the ground
11307.12, or say where you are or something like that. I hear you. Yeah if it's impossible to comply with
11313.44, both sets of orders. Especially when like the natural like conflicting information is going to
11318.880000000001, lead the person to accidentally. So for instance I got nervous in this video when the second
11322.96, cop showed up on the other side and started screaming at him like I could totally see myself like
11326.8, you turn around and like you drop your hands because you're not thinking and just like holy
11329.599999999999, shit and then you just like you get shot and just fucked up. Yeah yeah I it feels like a really
11333.919999999998, reckless stupid horrible fucking thing. Yeah. Do you know I mean you have a he sometimes like you
11340.88, might have a cop in the chat. Matt tips there. The reason for that is that. So he says my agency's
11345.599999999999, policy forbids multiple officers from giving commands at once you'll get in trouble if you do it.
11348.96, Okay. I mean that to me makes a little sense that you should have one person that's kind of the go
11354.08, the go person. I remember there's there's a video of like I don't know if you've ever seen it.
11358.8, Some sovereign citizen or some second amendment person walking into a police. Oh god yeah. Like
11366.0, armed to teeth. Yeah there's two of them one guy with a video camera one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And
11370.4, there's like there's the number the amount of orders that are being I mean that's kind of
11374.24, different situation because there. Yeah get down to the ground. Put your let me see your hands.
11376.72, Give me a put turn around. Yeah. It's like holy shit. Yeah. It's kind of like not a planned event
11381.92, as opposed to this where you would hope that they be like at least a word said all right I'm in
11386.88, charge of I'm taking lead or something. I hear that in terms of what actually interested in
11391.439999999999, more is the legal question about whether or not he's quote under arrest at that point.
11396.72, It might be relevant for purposes of knowing whether or not this was excessive force.
11401.04, Mm-hmm. I'm also curious what the qualified immunity arguments might be
11406.240000000002, for the state officers being sued for money damages presumably. I wonder if like there's
11412.640000000001, some kind of argument that the federal aspect of the agents work pre-amps state qualified immunity
11419.68, doctrine but typically I would think in like in a normal case I would think that qualified
11425.52, immunity would protect these officers from any kind of civil lawsuit for damages from a private
11431.28, citizen. Assuming there was no wrongdoing on their behalf right. Right so this I think would be in
11436.32, like the realm of ambiguity or whatever I don't know what the actual substantive standard is but
11441.68, it's quite generous for for law enforcement so I would I would presume that that this situation.
11447.92, Do you what did we stand on this so I think this might be like the most important thing I think
11454.16, qualified immunity is a good thing at least in theory absolutely. Do you disagree with them?
11458.08, I think to some extent you it's important because I while I don't take like to the maximal degree
11464.72, the notion that we absolutely need the strongest qualified immunity in order otherwise we won't
11469.76, have cops ever. Yeah. I do think that it's important that we not set a precedent where basically every
11476.4, single interaction with the cop means somebody's going to be getting sued like every single time
11479.76, it seems like. Yeah and then I really think I really think that there is a need to have good
11485.92, police officers and if we're just you know flooding the litigation and making them not even want to
11495.04, go into dangerous situations or take risks when situations call for risks and I think we might be
11500.960000000001, in a in a bad state but I think that there's a strong argument to be had that it's it doesn't
11505.52, need to be as strong as it is. Sure. Now I'm not the person to bring that argument because I'm not
11511.36, very well read on on the limits and meets and bounds of qualified immunity but I think I would
11516.48, agree with you that there needs to be some some qualified immunity just like this should be by the
11520.560000000001, way absolute immunity in certain cases. I can see reasons why there should be absolute immunity
11525.6, for the president in certain things. So should we be able to sue the president? Oh this was one of
11531.36, the Afghanistan. Yeah this is one of the I think everybody hated me on this take but it had to do
11535.6, with whether or not we should be able to like prosecute Trump after the White House. You might
11540.800000000001, have even disagree with me on this. I don't remember where you stood on this or maybe you were one of
11543.04, those where it like as much as I might have even gotten pushed over to yes. Yeah for anything and
11549.12, it was just like it was I don't know I think I've probably flipped flopped on this back and forth
11554.08, and I probably am going to do it again but like I think I barely stand on the side of no because
11558.24, like the precedent of prosecuting ex-presidents by current presidents sounds like what could be
11565.52, possibly the worst precedent to ever set like in your judicial anything for your country like
11571.119999999999, two easy cases and hard cases. So easy cases would be like it's not like a president like
11576.56, multiple like serial rape and murders in the Oval Office and then gets impeached or whatever like
11581.36, should they be thrown in jail at that point probably but it seems like what's the right two things
11585.52, let's have two two things. So one is should the president be immune from criminal prosecution
11591.2, while sitting in office? That's one and by the current office of legal counsel opinion which
11599.28, Robert Mueller followed was that the president while sitting office not the vice president but
11603.76, the president is immune from criminal this is just the office of legal counsel so it's not like
11608.800000000001, binding Supreme Court president. It says it can't be criminally prosecuted. That is a separate question
11613.04, I think and another interesting one then the absolute immunity argument for civil liability.
11618.080000000002, So let me give you the what I think is the easy case for absolute immunity in some in civil context.
11623.36, So Joe Biden decides to get out of Afghanistan and there's an I think a strong argument to be made
11629.12, that in certain respects the pullout was was not the most effective it could have been.
11634.160000000002, Yeah sure. And let's say that someone there was some negligence on the part of Joe Biden's conduct
11639.12, or there was some wrongful death that occurred as a result of that conduct should Joe Biden
11644.640000000001, for pulling out of Afghanistan be liable in civil court for damages caused by his pulling out
11650.960000000001, irresponsibly or negligently. And I think that that's the case where like of course not the
11656.320000000002, the president needs to be able to set policy and if that causes damages in many cases that's just
11660.960000000001, too bad a harder case to be real quick to qualify that the exact way to state this is you never ever
11667.84, ever ever won a president in the United States trying to decide if they should or shouldn't do
11672.64, some action based on like whether or not they're going to be prosecuted for it criminally.
11676.48, That's that's like this or or yeah or civil yeah sorry yeah.
11680.8, Like they should ideally be acting the best interest of the United States ideally right.
11684.56, This is why you don't have presidents from other countries for instance right.
11687.44, If we ever have a conflict with the country the president is born in a foreign country you don't
11690.4, want the president having to make a tough decision on behalf of Americans for like his home country
11694.24, that's like the idea. That's at least the logic of that yeah and I would say one way that you might
11699.76, think that a limitation on that is we're only the president when he's acting as the president but
11704.64, not the president when he's occupying role as citizen. Sure but that that line is super
11709.6, blurry like what does the president do that's not in furtherance of his office all the time.
11713.84, You could argue that Trump's attacks Twitter attacks on people while he's in office is part
11719.28, of his role as president. So it's hard the absolute encompassing nature of the presidency I think
11726.480000000001, is like a very unique thing in American politics which it's hard for me to like put a limit on what
11732.16, that means. Yeah there is Supreme Court precedent saying that a president can be civilly sort of
11740.320000000002, challenged in suit for things not occurring while in office that's a Clinton case where there were
11746.32, stuff predating his presidency where he could be super wall in office. That's one set of things
11750.88, which I don't know do you agree that for the most part the president should be immune from
11754.96, civil liability for actions taken wall in office. Well under the yeah I do but do we.
11762.8, Because like let's say we're in since like we talk about like the president obviously you
11765.68, shouldn't be able to like well I guess when we talk about like murdering people we're talking
11769.199999999999, about like criminal charges and civil charges right or yes so first civil in it and I do want
11773.12, to get into criminal defense all right. Okay I mean I think you have to be immune it seems like it
11778.880000000001, what's the most extreme type of like civil case you could think of. So I can think of like let's
11782.720000000001, say the president of the United States makes a contract wall in office because the president
11788.08, could make a contract right. Yep. Say that Trump signs a deal it's to like if someone gives him a
11795.52, billion dollars and in exchange he gives him the whole business and then he takes the billion
11801.28, dollars and just never gives over the business. Should you be able to go I mean that is just
11805.28, something that seems totally removed from the presidency. He's just essentially stole a billion
11809.84, dollars. Yeah can't you sue him for that. It gets weird I almost think that like these are clear
11813.92, cut almost because if it's a contract it's pretty obviously not in the it's he's not serving
11819.2, as a president. Yeah because what contract is a president signing right. He signs things as
11823.52, the executive right so bills into law or you know executive orders or whatever but in terms of
11828.0, signing a contract between himself as a person that's necessarily not like a presidential thing.
11832.4, That's you acknowledging that there is there are some there's some conduct which can't reasonably
11838.08, be called within the scope of the presidential office for which he should be liable even while
11842.08, in office. Some people in chatter saying that breaking that contract would be criminal.
11847.28, No. Why would it be criminal. I don't because Twitch said it but okay so I got it.
11851.36, I would break in a contract. I mean people break contract. Yeah is there a law against breaking a
11855.44, contract or I don't understand that. Okay. Clear. Clear. Clear. Okay. This one's super hard.
11862.960000000001, I think there's a strong argument that I don't want Joe Biden being liable for some
11870.560000000001, crime in Alabama because just one district attorney decides that he's going to bring a case in some
11878.560000000001, district where he's hated. That seems like a ton of power that like one prosecutor maybe even
11884.16, unelected could arrest the president of the United States for some random thing. So that's me being
11891.2, uncomfortable with not even just states having that power like state prosecutors say we're not
11897.6, really in the federal world. I'm just envisioning the maximal worst thing. State prosecutor potentially
11902.32, unelected being able to just arrest the president of the United States. So here's like a weird question.
11906.96, Are there extradition requirements for state cases?
11909.84, Like let's say for instance like a crazy like South Carolina lawyer decides like okay where
11916.64, we have an arrest warrant for Biden could bind just like okay well I'm never going to South
11919.76, Carolina like it fucked. Like would he be a little bit like other states like extra item to South
11924.4, Carolina. There's a full faith in credit clause of the Constitution which essentially says that
11929.12, courts have to have to respect the like official judgments of other state courts and stuff like
11936.72, that. And so for the most part I think that states that there might be issues here and there.
11942.24, Hold on. I'm not going to speak from personal experience okay.
11945.92, While that might be true that they have to respect judgments from other states I don't believe I'm
11951.039999999999, almost positive that arrest warrants are absolutely not like reciprocated to every state. Like if I
11956.08, ever warrant for me in Iowa if I get arrested in another state I don't think that they'll ship me
11961.119999999999, off to Iowa for that warrant if it's for like a traffic or two. I wonder if it's for certain
11965.2, crimes maybe if they're like like other felonies maybe but. Yeah I'm not sure if there's a it's
11972.16, probably not a matter of like absolute law that an absolute practice at every time that you have a
11977.28, warrant somewhere else that you get brought there but I know there are cases where people are
11981.84, extradited to other states to face charges in that state whether or not it's mandatory I'm not sure.
11986.960000000001, And I know sort of casually people were like I don't go to Florida or I don't go there because I
11991.6, have an outstanding warrant or something. So as a matter of practicality oftentimes avoid in this
11996.56, thing might be a good idea if you have an outstanding warrant there and community states don't always
11999.84, talk to each other either so yeah okay but the more interesting question I think is the presidential
12006.08, role here because the other side of the equation is not that a state like has some trumped up charge
12013.2, against a president just one prosecutor decides that he's liable. The other side of the equation is
12018.16, Trump starts machine gunning everyone in New York City and how could he not be subject to
12026.56, criminal prosecution where he did do something like that if he literally was doing that and that
12031.44, seems to be what the logic of the OLC memo implies and so I'm curious is there a line on criminal
12040.0, prosecution you drew a line in civil litigation context would you draw a line in the criminal
12045.76, context there would have to be a line somewhere right I mean there have to be right like I don't
12052.4, think I would bite the bullet and say like I mean if he's got you know enough rounds he should be
12055.84, able to kill as many people as possible as a president right. Well the question is one of
12059.28, institutional competency I think ultimately I see someone in the chat says well he'd get impeached
12065.92, that's not the question we're asking the question is should the process that's avoiding the question
12069.84, that's saying of course we already know that he could be impeached for that stuff and potentially
12073.84, prosecuted after he leaves office but the question is should a prosecutor independently and the police
12080.960000000001, have the authority to arrest the city and president of the United States for suspicion of having
12086.72, committed a crime that's that's the question and if you say well he'll be impeached that's that's
12091.36, really not answering that question yeah thoughts one on what we just talked about or what do you
12098.96, mean yeah like do you think that if Joe Biden starts shooting people on Fifth Avenue well yeah I said
12105.599999999999, like there must be there has to be some like line works like this is too much yeah that's a hard
12111.599999999999, one though I guess but this this might be one of those gentlemen's agreements I guess that we have
12115.359999999999, where hopefully the president doesn't do something like this because we got tested it would be like a
12119.119999999999, shit show um I don't know I feel like with Trump a lot of those lines got more yeah absolutely and
12125.84, in the Senate everything is well right you know um yeah I don't know okay um before I leave two
12133.04, two last things one is before I make you mad oh boy the lawyer batch I mean I did what you asked
12144.0, did I tell you I'd give you a badge if you passed your bar yeah I mean everyone has been
12148.0, talking about it on stop and it was said and you literally repeated it that you'd give me a flair
12154.4, once once I pass okay I'll you know what whoever makes my flares and chat okay make a cook up a
12159.039999999999, lawyer flare all right and then yeah okay you I think it's you apple is an esports
12163.279999999999, bad mental look at one all right yeah all right number two I'm sorry to bring it up oh man what's
12168.8, your definition of terrorism I don't know dude I don't have one you don't have a definition of
12174.0, terrorism no it's a political term I don't believe there's a consistent coherent definition of
12177.68, terrorism no so you I mean would you call anything terrorist stick uh making common parlance yeah but
12184.48, not like as a levy like for an individual charge or whatever I don't think so so you don't you
12188.48, don't think terrorism should have a definition uh if we want it well at this point no because
12193.28, everybody uses the word for everything so now at this point in a perfect world then maybe it could
12196.880000000001, maybe I don't know like the only reason anyone who calls anything terrorist do I what
12202.08, who critters anyone who calls anything terrorism no because people use it as all the time anyway
12205.84, so it's what's the point so you would make no distinction of someone calling a bombing attack
12211.76, terrorism um they're just as irrational someone calling um here so here's picking up a preschool
12218.4, terrorist yeah okay so you asked me something you asked me a really good question earlier um
12222.56, when I kept trying to push on like is this an arrest or a detainment right yeah and what you
12226.880000000001, asked me was what's the point why do you care um which is a good question so I would I would like
12231.92, turn this question around and say the same thing so if you're asking me like you know should this
12235.44, be called terrorist or blah blah blah blah if it's just like you know on the news or in social
12239.36, media whatever that's oh shit sorry if it's like in the news is social media or something like that's
12243.92, one thing um but if we're talking about creating like a special classification of charges or like
12248.720000000001, a special legal doctrine to deal with it then that's a totally different question um I just my my
12254.24, thing the reason I don't really like the word terrorist is because when you start saying things
12258.24, like people that are trying to you know achieve a political end through violence or whatever it's
12263.2, like it's so so so broad um it's so so so broad that I just I don't see how almost anything couldn't
12270.320000000002, theoretically fit under that definition that's my problem but if you insist that if you follow
12278.560000000001, the definition or if you had a definition maybe you could insist in some limiting principle yeah
12283.12, maybe so like here here's like something that I would ask you okay um could you give me a definition
12288.48, of terrorism that like would include yeah so yeah so like it would include somebody going to bomb
12293.92, a building right yep but it would exclude one right I mean it wouldn't it wouldn't include you
12298.72, bombing a building um in order to get insurance money probably not sure um it it wouldn't include
12308.0, bombing a building because you're just what if what if you bomb what if you bomb the building to
12312.48, get insurance money though because you thought democrats like destroyed your country you could
12315.44, make money any other way um that I think is closer yeah I mean it would depend I think what what
12322.560000000001, matters is the motivation ultimately is it for a political end now they're good now but like that's
12328.4, what I'm saying the problem is that word political like what about an in cell murders yeah if an
12332.800000000001, in cell kills like five women because he hates women and he thinks that like we need to have like
12335.68, the insul uprising is that political like there are I think those they're definitely hard cases for
12340.8, sure um and there are cases that I think um so for instance what if there's a mixed motive what if
12346.72, you both want the insurance money so there's a personal financial remuneration motive behind it
12352.24, but there's also this underlying political motive those are hard cases yeah and those it really
12356.4, stretches the limits here but that's true of any category there are going to be hard cases yeah for
12361.759999999998, sure I just put our easy cases where it's clearly a political motive for sure um I think I would
12368.4, actually echo AOC here um because I think she said something surprisingly salient um when she was
12375.52, talking about the January 6th stuff and what she said was um I'm paraphrasing but she basically
12381.119999999999, made it between she's like everybody's calling for like new charges for these people for terrorists
12384.48, blah blah blah blah we don't need that these were criminal things these were criminal activities
12389.279999999999, that we have charges for yeah you have conspiracy you have right so if people do things like that
12393.92, charge them for it but like should there be like a rise like does it rise to a different type of
12398.8, activity if it's quote unquote terrorism um I don't know what about like people that what about
12403.68, people that looted during BLM riots does that count as political because those were that's yeah go
12408.24, ahead let me address some of that stuff so one is on the question of whether or not we need a new
12413.12, regime to deal with criminal terrorism either by increasing surveillance of of people and and
12419.68, trespassing upon civil liberties I think the answer is no we don't need that if you also want
12425.28, like an increase in the severity of the offense um I wouldn't want that necessarily these are
12430.08, independent crimes that have that should be treated I think by and large um the same as any other
12436.880000000001, of this kind of guilty act little asterisk here there are a lot of people who want to put
12442.0, intensifiers for acts done for racist motivations you're aware of that right so hate crime type
12448.0, intensifiers uh-huh or do you agree that that should be a thing or I don't actually know I'm not sure
12453.12, um I I think that I could be moved really quickly off of that I don't know if a murder being a hate
12459.84, crime should necessarily make it worse that feels really weird to me the more that I think about it
12464.16, but I haven't spent a great deal of time dwelling on that subject so I'd have to think more about it
12468.4, well I would say the logic if you're against terrorism being used as an intensifier for crimes
12473.6, I think uh unless you're you're saying that racism is worse than terrorism um and maybe you do think
12479.76, that um the logic of of keeping as an intensifier would be the same but I don't I don't find that
12484.880000000001, necessary the reason why I care is because I think there's been a lot of downplaying of
12488.880000000001, January 6th and it makes me sick and I think it's quite clear that what was going on here was
12495.6, I'll give you some an easy question so the people who were literally- wait real quick I have a
12502.32, conversation I was supposed to do seven minutes ago um I am gonna be on later tonight but if yeah
12505.76, you can hit me with one more question I just don't want to make it one more question then you have
12508.24, to go off I'm keeping you from Lawrence other yes the Nazi queen okay sorry about that uh have
12512.88, I won that conversation um but I guess my last question is for the people who are literally
12517.68, beating police officers uh capital police officers in January 6th they're people who are
12522.16, explicitly doing violence and uh explicitly let's say to overturn the results of the presidential
12528.64, election that that's on both people at least for those people those are that's unquestionably
12533.119999999999, terrorism right I love you dude no I just I think that the charge should be for attacking people
12542.0, just give them the charge and the scheme it's a little bit label I just like what if it's like
12547.76, what if it's terrorism that we agree with I'm giving you easy cases you're saying these are
12551.359999999999, easy but like what if it's terrorism that we agree with should that be like retroactively made
12556.0, okay so for instance a lot of the civil rights stuff that got violent was absolutely terrorism
12561.6, but like retroactively we you know 1964 we get the civil rights act and everything like okay like
12565.68, well fuck they were in the right so like how does that what the examples of terrorism from the civil
12569.44, rights movement um then when there there were violent protests that happened under different
12572.64, groups they repeat with the black panthers were a bit more extreme back then um I know that um at
12576.96, different times in his life Malcolm X was a little bit more on board with like violent outcome
12580.56, um with how the next was was on board with like violent means for protests and stuff um I
12587.68, I would have to go back and find some examples are you telling me that you don't think there was
12589.84, ever like a violent uh right or protest for I think there there possibly was and yeah but I think
12594.8, that that's that's totally that's totally fits the definition that I mean yeah but that's I'm just
12599.92, uncomfortable because it's like it's so political and like it's political which is the same reason
12604.72, why yeah I don't know I just that's funny you have to go to the conversation but yeah thanks for
12608.32, having me on and if you're available later maybe look yeah if you want to talk about this later
12610.88, absolutely sure it's just yeah this just it's a really difficult that's a difficult one yeah but
12614.8, okay cool we'll talk about it okay I love you buddy okay I'll be back I'll be back I'll be back
12617.76, on one second and I'm trying to win uh Lauren one second
12627.36, yellow hello hello hello hey what's going uh real quick chat
12632.32, how are his levels in my levels how are the levels levels levels I think he's a little better
12640.48, okay how's it going what have you been up to tonight just uh you know playing a little bit of league
12647.6, playing a little bit of dnd having talks with people you know the good stuff
12652.56, good league awesome I'm sure you're really uh low stress today don't wait my league games are
12658.64, hours ago so I'm not ready to uh to scream you come down right now yeah all right so the ball
12665.92, doing the situation we got into a little back and forth yeah in the instant messages that absolutely
12671.439999999999, no one saw except us apparently true um your position right now you say is just that let me pull
12679.039999999999, it up here and if I could figure out how my computer works so you said your main points are
12685.52, just none of this is simple gun safety and two it's silly to assign blame to people until all the
12691.52, details come out I like half agree with both these points but also half disagree okay I fully
12697.12, agree and I'm ready to fight to the death on both of these points wonderful all right so the first
12703.04, point I've seen you say like actors don't have to follow traditional gun safety because obviously
12709.92, they you know you have everyone coming out including myself that have been like whoa there are simple
12714.08, gun safety protocols that could have prevented this and your main response to make sure I'm not
12718.8, you know misrepresenting you has been actors obviously don't have to follow simple gun
12724.48, protocol because in some cases they point the gun towards people or camera or whatever for a scene
12729.6, yeah so I would say gun I would say that actors necessarily don't follow basic gun safety but
12735.2, rather there is an advanced gun safety that would apply when it comes to actors and with firearms
12739.44, yeah so that like that's that's where I agree like if it's not basic gun safety that you would
12745.68, follow at a range it's literally even more intense gun safety protocols that they would have and I
12751.12, feel like when people say whoa actors don't have to follow gun safety they get to violate it this
12756.720000000001, doesn't apply to them to me it feels like if this incident happened to an army general and he
12762.960000000001, accidentally shot a private during a training session people obfuscating by coming out and
12768.24, saying well it's a soldier's job to violate gun protocol you know soldiers don't have to
12773.199999999999, appear in a civilian standard I'd be like well yes but in very specific instances that obviously
12779.28, did not apply to this so I would be okay I'm gonna be very careful on my wordage here okay I've
12786.72, had one a very rough conversation with this okay so I would say that that is a very bad example now
12792.72, I've got some that's in my chat if I say something that's incorrect about military experience please go
12798.32, ahead and point me in the direction of something else but my understanding is you would absolutely
12804.32, never on any base whether deployed or at home or whatever be in a situation where you're treating
12810.24, your firearm like an actor so if a general or somebody in the military shot somebody else in
12814.72, the military it would be like you failed some basic fundamental safety thing with the only
12820.16, exception being maybe like in a crazy active combat situation but anything happening on base
12824.48, if you shoot somebody else if there is an negligent discharge it is because you actually
12828.24, fucked up basic gun safety that's my assumption on that so I wouldn't compare the tower but say
12831.92, that for actors the situation is far more complex well okay no so like well it's the same thing
12838.8, for actors where there is not a single circumstance where you would point a gun with real ammo in
12843.84, it towards another person right so something fundamentally was fucked up there as well wait
12848.48, stop I'm just gonna cut you in it so no so I'm not making a direct one-to-one
12853.039999999999, wait wait but I know but you're saying so you're saying that it's the same way
12856.08, where actors wouldn't point a gun with live ammo I'm saying that if you're a military
12859.84, personnel my understanding is that you are never pointing a gun at another person ever
12863.6, whether it's empty or not that's just not something you should do where's you point a gun at other
12867.279999999999, people as military you shoot to kill people when you're in a wartime situation I mean against other
12874.24, friendly soldiers on base I'm not talking about killing somebody that would be an appropriate use
12878.24, of a firearm because you're intending to destroy the target right right so that's the point I'm making
12883.039999999999, though the point I'm making is in both these jobs normal gun safety is followed 99 percent of the
12888.88, time but there are exceptions for soldiers it's when they are in action they are fighting the enemy
12894.0, and for actors it's when they are doing a shot where the gun is pointed at the camera or towards
12899.28, another person and in both of these instances there are extreme protocols that apply to ensure
12905.52, you don't have quote-unquote friendly fire of course that term is but I don't understand if
12910.880000000001, you're firing on an an adversary what what rule of gun fire are you breaking
12917.68, sorry what like basic civilian gun safety no no wait okay so I'm asking whether at another
12922.16, person in general that's that's not basic or point that no no no basics you are you seeing
12925.92, civilians get to just shoot people at a range I know you're not saying that but like I'm confused
12930.16, with of course they're violating basic civilian so there is there is no there is not a basic gun
12935.52, rule this is don't shoot people right my understanding of the four fundamental cardinal rules of firearm
12944.08, is that you treat every firearm as though it's loaded you only point the firearm at a target
12948.0, you're willing to destroy you keep your finger off the trigger until you're ready to fire and
12951.68, you're always aware of what's beyond your target if you're aiming at somebody with the intention to
12954.96, shoot and kill them that's not an improper use of a firearm it follows all four cardinal rules and
12958.64, it can totally be fair in an active combat situation you're not violating a safety procedure there or
12962.56, doing anything extraordinary by pointing at an enemy combat and killing them you're doing exactly
12966.32, as you intend to do with a firearm much the same as when you shoot and destroy a target you can
12969.519999999999, shoot and try to kill another person right but like in it i mean that's that's a fair point but
12975.519999999999, even in in Canada for example like something you want to shoot and destroy or the circumstances
12982.48, that they use a gun in the military and how they use them are still different from how civilians
12987.359999999999, use them can we agree on that at least no i feel like i don't i just don't agree on that what do you
12991.92, mean i don't understand what's different like military are able to use guns in different ways
12996.56, than civilians are i know i think for i think for the military police as well i i don't i don't think
13002.88, so no i think that in any of these situations you cannot indiscriminately shoot and kill people you
13008.08, need a just a proper justification to do so especially in the military you need a proper
13011.76, justification to kill somebody but that's the exact same rule applied to a civilian as well right
13014.880000000001, for self-defense or something you need like a you have like an elevated standard you've got a
13018.24, defense you to apply a court for i shot and kill this person for this reason but it's the same thing
13021.12, for the military as well no no no no no no no no no as a police officer i can or as a civilian i
13025.84, can't just go up to someone and point a gun at them and be like get on the ground i'm arresting you
13030.0, there are of course instances where military and police have more rights with guns than the regular
13035.92, civilian or different uses of guns than the regular civilian would um in in the i of i'm being very
13044.08, generous i guess in the commission of an arrest i could agree sure um sure yeah yeah okay so yeah
13050.8, i feel like that's getting into the weeds though my point is that there are jobs where use of a gun
13056.16, will differ in some instances from regular civilian use can we agree on that uh in very niche scenarios
13062.0, although almost those are still almost completely following all of the cardinal rules of fire on
13065.68, ownership for instance of a police who's aiming a gun at a perpetrator it's because they are about
13069.2, to will lethal intent they're treating the gun as i was loaded their fingers i'll treat right but
13072.8, but i i can grant you this maybe it's not important we can move on to the next thing sure yeah i just
13076.24, yeah i don't think it's important so um but with with the baldwin situation can we at least agree
13082.88, here whether it be hollywood's regular standards or regular civilian standards gun safety protocol
13090.72, was not followed on set but like not even talking about baldwin in general in the event of somebody
13095.76, getting shot that's almost necessarily true the only thing i can think of is with a crazy
13100.88, malicious actor certain certain results are but even at that point there's probably some safety
13103.679999999998, real not being followed so yeah i can almost like 100 agree that if somebody got shot clearly
13108.08, something some safety protocol wasn't being fired okay yeah so i i think we can at least agree
13113.599999999999, there and for me like no matter what our thoughts are on the issue no matter how either of us feel
13118.56, either of us feel about baldwin you know i don't really care about the political stuff with baldwin
13122.96, i only even figured out about his um the the skit with donald trump recently like me is there gonna be
13129.92, is there careful hold on is there gonna be a bunch of people posting in my subreddit where you've
13133.68, got a video or it's like this is where i do my 45-minute breakdown on allak baldwin's horrible
13137.359999999999, trumpet personation why he's not patriotic or i was just thinking i was like i what if i did a sky
13142.72, news interview like a year or two ago i'm just holding them okay i'm just saying those teleprombers
13147.52, only get you so far but go ahead all right what's your next part um no my my points there is that
13153.04, no matter how we feel about him or the politics around it um assuming not all of these people are
13159.36, just lying for whatever reason we know that other actors have come out and said this situation
13164.16, with baldwin is bizarre and they generally as rule of thumb check their guns before use
13169.44, with the armorer we know that experts wait wait wait wait wait wait wait who says they check
13174.0, with the arm so actors have come out and said like jeff right said i do not recall ever being
13180.4, handed a weapon that wasn't declared or that wasn't cleared in front of me sure so here's
13185.44, so here's something that i've seen in a wide variety of articles so it is absolutely the case
13191.04, i've seen this ubiquitously that there are two people involved in clearing a firearm that the
13195.84, either prop master or armor and then the assistant director or whoever is like handing the firearm
13200.8, to the to the actor and i've seen these used interchange with a prop master armor assistant
13204.96, director but some combination of at least two people are checking this clearing it and then
13208.32, giving it to the actor i've seen a ton of mixed stuff on whether or not the actors themselves
13214.32, are involved in manually expecting the clearing i don't think i would not be comfortable and i
13219.199999999999, don't think it was your cover saying that like oh on every single set the actor is going to be
13222.24, involved in in clearing the firearm or in washing the fire be cleared that seems to be a responsibility
13226.72, almost completely delegated to the armor with one other person there is like a double safety
13231.84, check the assistant director or prop master yeah i'll agree with you that one of the big problems
13236.32, with this conversation is that they don't actually have like law that applies to firearm use on sets
13242.88, it's mostly in fact i was reading an article that said under industry protocols oh sorry where is
13248.56, it wait can you say that again you said law doesn't apply to firearm use on it yeah so there isn't like
13253.76, specific rules like by state how firearms should be used on a set right so like for Hollywood and
13261.2, how they're used so what i was reading and i'm just going to get this article up for you so i actually
13265.92, am quoting something um safety standards developed by film studios and labor unions are the primary
13273.6, protection for actors and film crews when a scene calls for using prop guns the industry wide guidance
13278.72, is clear blanks can kill tree all firearms as if they're loaded this is from um the associated press
13284.8, news or ap news uh and it's just talking about the fact that you know they're actually
13291.039999999999, is not um across the board industry standard that is applied different production companies have
13297.359999999999, different guidelines and there's like a general world but yeah everybody every set so i think
13301.519999999999, that causes a lot of other send you the article so you know i will say though on a side note to that
13306.4, it seems like in general that's fine because accidents with firearms on sets in the united states are
13311.92, unbelievably rare uh is my understanding it is incredibly rare that like these types of incidents
13316.56, happen where i don't want to say the last one was Brandon Lee but i don't know there's been more
13320.88, recent ones because i was looking at uh apparently there was one in like 2017 i was reading a bunch
13325.6, of articles about um but uh yeah so what i was going to say there is i agree it's a really complex
13332.88, conversation to have because they don't have these exact standards that are outlined in law but
13339.679999999998, there is industry standards states typically appeal to like the union guidelines and when i'm
13345.039999999999, seeing all these interviews uh with experts with actors consistently i'm seeing the exact same thing
13351.279999999999, which is you know so they just did a big um interview with uh on gun safety with experts that
13358.72, tend to provide uh armor guns all these things so he said this guy he's Chandler cornblum vice
13366.08, president of movie armaments group a Toronto based weapons supplier every time we hand off a gun
13371.679999999998, on set to talent we showed the chamber for and magazine the actor has to signal that they accept
13376.72, the gun is empty only then do i hand off the gun that also backs up what Ray Liotta the uh he's from
13382.8, um god yeah wait so real quick yeah so real quick none of this matters it might be the case
13387.519999999999, just say it does but i don't care because if these people weren't the one setting the rules on this
13393.279999999999, production it doesn't really matter what they do they're going to say that that's why that's why
13396.48, i'm mentioning this because i'm about to get to that okay so Ray Liotta from you know godfather
13402.16, they always that i know of they check it so that you can see it they give it to the person you're
13406.0, pointing the gun at they do it to the producer they show everyone who is there that it doesn't work so
13410.16, we've got all these articles we've got experts saying that is the industry standard wait actually
13415.119999999999, i really i really i want to see that quote they show every single person on set they walk around
13421.119999999999, to every person and clear it in front of them is that actually they give it to the person you're
13425.36, pointing the gun at they do it to the producer they show whoever is there that it doesn't work so
13429.36, whoever is going to be around and involved in that shot which makes sense with yeah i mean i'll send
13435.2, you that okay so like that was my understanding too that the four or the four people that are shown
13443.52, are typically you know the people that are going to be most affected the well the the armor of course
13449.68, the assistant director as you already mentioned the actor because they're going to be handling
13453.92, and holding it and then whoever the gun is going to be aimed in the direction of now all these articles
13458.800000000001, i have in reading say that often movie magic is used so they'll put it a bit to the side to ensure
13463.52, safety they'll use cgi whatever needs to happen so it's not directly pointing at them but sometimes
13468.960000000001, it can happen where it is directly pointed at the camera or someone else and in those cases
13474.800000000001, the standard appears to be showing the person it's pointed at even if it's just the cameraman
13479.92, that it's empty so that they all feel safe so there's the article i just sent you
13484.48, and yeah so like you said this isn't relevant if they weren't working on the actual rust set because
13489.92, maybe rust decided to have standards that were different from all these other people in the
13494.8, industry saying that this is bizarre and mind-boggling to them the only problem with that is we now
13500.24, and unless she is completely lying for some reason uh we now have had rust set people working on the
13506.24, rust set say that was their expectation on the set and saying that was their standard so
13512.56, saying what was the standard that this standard of showing everyone involved in the shot or the
13518.16, person behind the camera can you yeah can you link me article showing that yeah i'll just grab that
13523.84, sorry i've got i've done a terrible organization job of my articles
13533.36, okay yeah here we go so it was the
13539.52, i'll just link it to you here
13541.52, so in reading through just real quick so in reading through some of these right so i'm not
13549.44, seeing a requirement now there are people saying i'm reading the first of the fox news
13552.640000000001, i'm not saying it's a requirement i've said this whole time that that's a guideline in an
13556.24, industry standard that there's a when i okay when i say requirement i mean like this is the procedure
13560.24, followed on set right so this guy is saying we've already we've already established that there
13565.76, isn't any specific like legal requirement there's just an industry standard that when i'm that's
13570.96, i'm talking about like the industry standard yeah so like was this like a like was it
13576.48, to amount of these the word requirement if it's not a legal thing or here i'll send you the
13582.16, that company article where yeah every time we hand a gun off this is the toronto based weapons
13587.119999999999, supplier for sets we make sure to show the actor they accept and then they do a hand off and say
13593.439999999999, yes the gun is clear and i've seen this so here's i actually found an article for 20 from 2017 that
13599.2, asserted this as well because i wanted to make sure the articles i was getting weren't biased about
13604.0, the um the baldwin situation so this is one from 2017 which states each time a gun is handed to a
13610.480000000001, performer um the armorer must open the weapons breach and present it to the performer with verbal
13616.560000000001, confirmation such as the weapon is clear when the performer is satisfied that the gun is not loaded
13621.28, they should audibly confirm clear and apparently this is often used with with a flashlight as well
13626.0, and you know i say this also i i live in vancouver or how can you explain to me my life just in terms of
13631.04, this works on sets here and they've all asserted to be yeah that's very how would you how do you
13635.92, clear a gun that has blanks how does that make sense well you did you you show them that either
13642.32, the guy that it's empty or whatever is supposed to be so you take so you're telling me that on these
13646.64, sets they're removing every single round from the chamber and they're looking to the side for the
13651.84, whole well how do you know they're blanks then no because you can tell from the back i mean we
13656.56, i was just reading an article about the armorer who says there's a little kind of circle sign on
13661.04, the back of the um on the back of the ammo that shows you it's a blank and i i hadn't the article
13668.880000000001, was saying they they may have missed there might have been one in there obviously evidently so
13674.72, my understanding is that there is three you can tell you can tell from the back of the
13678.72, bullet or blank what it is it so i'm guessing this is whether the primer has been um either
13685.119999999999, squibbed out or hit or whatever or the the primer has removed i think for some of these bullets
13688.72, but you you would have to manually investigate like the back of you wouldn't be able to just
13691.92, glance you'd have to actually like have the person so if it's like a magazine although i guess you
13695.76, wouldn't do that for a revolver you'd have to like check the back of every single bullet on these sets
13700.08, for like to check between like is it a dummy round is it a blank is a live round like it wouldn't
13704.16, just be a quick glance you'd have to actually go through like every bullet like i the back of
13707.44, every single bullet so it's either the front or the back but they do have a way of indicating what it
13713.04, is and they will put a flashlight in there or whatever they need to do to show the actor to show
13717.28, the person who's potentially going to be in the line of fire or near it they show them uh from
13722.560000000001, what i've read as industry standard that either the gun has nothing in it if it's just being if
13728.4, they're using movie magic and cgi instead of a blank to make the gun noise and everything so
13733.12, so that nothing is in it or to show that yes it is blanks those are the blanks there they are
13738.320000000002, here's your gun just so you know it's full of blanks here you go uh key grip it's full of blanks
13742.880000000001, which is why i wanted to read this article which is the um so this person here so um because i see
13748.880000000001, i'm just i haven't gone through all the the like the new york post its stories on this yet so Stacy
13754.480000000001, Mickey Evans who is this person it says a location manager location manager for rest yeah and she
13759.84, said a massive mistake was made there are massive no i know so i can see what she's in the article
13763.68, but i'm curious like who do i trust this person's word for the procedure more than like the armor
13768.48, and the ad and the i'm like the producer like on set like is this person somebody that is directly
13772.880000000001, involved with doing all of this stuff or can i just finish reading what she said and then i'll
13777.68, answer that do you mind go for it yeah so she noted that the armrest assistant director and the key
13783.68, grip are supposed to check the gun no matter what's going on on set and then very lastly the actor
13788.88, checks the gun she said of baldwin who is also one of the movie's executive producers so there
13793.039999999999, are four to five people in this stage but somehow there was a failure so to me yes i agree you don't
13799.599999999999, just trust the location manager for rest on what uh what the procedure was on their set out of nowhere
13806.72, especially if it sounds bizarre but when she's obviously going to be directly involved in in the
13812.64, production and you have all these other voices in the industry companies that rent out guns arm
13818.24, wrists other actors saying yes this is the way so hold on real quick okay wait wait wait wait
13823.6, wait wait wait it sounds a whole lot less bizarre right no no you're building a case on a whole
13828.0, bunch of nothing right so it's not nothing everything you said so far is nothing right so
13833.119999999999, so and it's so a company that literally provides weapons for film sets so a company
13839.76, it's our procedure yeah yes nothing correct and someone who works on the rest set saying that
13844.08, was our procedure as well is nothing so i'm sorry that's that's absurd okay a company out of toronto
13850.4, is not relevant here because they weren't the ones running this production number one okay
13854.32, stories from people on other sets i'm showing what a standard is i know they were working on it
13858.16, it's not a standard because you have a fox news article that points to two or three people to
13861.36, say this right because in all the articles and i think you even admitted this we both have said
13865.52, that there is widely different standards from set to set to set to set right it doesn't seem to be
13869.36, the case that is you it is ubiquitous that actors check the guns that means that yes we can probably
13873.36, find a lot of actors say oh yeah we check guns because that's what we do in set but there's a lot
13876.960000000001, of them that don't as well right do you not agree with that do you think it is ubiquitous
13881.52, standard set across all sets i i have not i've yet to find an article that is like oh yeah you know
13886.960000000001, we never as an actor i never checked the guns on my set this is normal i mean if you have an article
13892.32, like that where an actor is saying actually this is normal this has nothing to do with baldwin
13896.800000000001, usually when we're past the gosh hold on you're going way way way far i'm saying nothing i'm
13900.88, saying because all i have is a bunch of actors and armoureists and companies saying this is normal
13905.439999999999, and you're just saying side swipe that away because i do you do you understand do you understand that
13911.679999999998, you could give me 20 different production companies that's that say that this is the way that they do
13915.839999999998, things and it still doesn't further your argument like a single step sorry could you repeat that
13921.439999999999, you could give me 20 different companies that all say this is how we handle this and it doesn't
13925.92, further your argument at all right you can get it right so that's why i said okay here's a standard
13930.0, that's being applied i'm not saying it's necessarily rust could be an exception to the general rule
13934.8, which sounds like a very normal rule to have to ensure people don't get hurt sure the exception
13940.8, to yeah what all these actors and experts have been saying but we now also have someone who did
13946.08, work on the production who was saying this was standard as well and you can swipe that away and
13950.56, say you know that was just uh she didn't work directly with the guns fine but like it's see it
13958.96, does appear that that was an industry standard no it does so you didn't understand what i said
13963.199999999999, okay you could give me a hundred companies that do things this way that doesn't that doesn't build
13969.599999999999, an argument towards what the rules were on this set that does that goes nothing you could give me
13973.759999999998, 500 companies to do that right that's why i gave you someone who worked on the set exactly so we've
13977.839999999998, moved past yeah but the problem is you're bouncing around from piece of evidence piece of evidence
13981.519999999999, every time i'm trying to point out this doesn't necessarily build towards your case so when you
13984.56, give me the person on set that's making this decision that's saying this thing about like oh
13988.8, four people are responsible for checking the weapon i haven't seen this repeated in any other
13993.119999999999, media source so i'm curious who is stacey micky evans and this person is just a location manager
13998.88, is this person ever even on set during filming do they know any of the procedures on set
14003.039999999999, like a location manager just finds places to to film wait yeah this this article is literally
14009.52, floating an interview from an australian outlet so it was a radio interview so we can go it may be
14016.720000000001, like i are suggesting that because you haven't seen this from other sources it's fake no no no no
14021.6, i'm saying what's the suggestion there hold on i did not say that at all what i know i know but
14025.36, i'm trying to understand why you pointed that out like why does it matter because there are a whole
14030.24, bunch of people that are quoting like the i don't know if the ad has given statements but the police
14036.0, department has given statements the prosecutor has given statements and then there have been people
14039.84, close to this on set that have given statements this is the first time i've seen a statement by the
14043.44, location manager about this so i'm curious like what is the location manager have to do with like
14049.6, setting procedures on set is this somebody that's actually involved in anything related to the
14054.16, production or the filming or is this just somebody that like signs off on a location and doesn't even
14058.32, show up to a single day of work on set the people working on set i mean this is also an industry
14065.44, standard and should be done by the armorer they are all given kind of firearm safety and
14070.880000000001, instructions if they're going to be using real firearms on set which they were on rest so was the
14076.800000000001, location manager at the rest location did she go there was she there during filming i assumed she
14083.2, was there and it had a lot of dealings with the actual production company i think that's fair to
14088.560000000001, say was she there at that exact incident i mean fair enough you don't know but i the question would
14094.4, be like so somebody that does like costumes and makeup is going to be on set and everything right
14099.199999999999, but i don't know if i would expect that person to know anything about the proper procedures for
14103.44, handling a firearm during a scene i'm not saying that she knows the exact procedure then why is she
14108.16, the quote that you're giving me in this article because that's what this new york post article is
14112.72, quoting that's you gave me this one saying this is showing that alic bollard was required to clear
14116.32, it this is the location manager i don't know if this person saying that there would be the majority
14120.24, of people on set given what everyone else is saying in the standard is that they are generally
14124.72, educated on firearm safety and they would know the general protocol and also this general protocol
14130.64, she is talking about seems to be the general protocol in hollywood in overall with actors with
14137.76, armrest companies talking about that saying yep that's what we do and in your time working in hollywood
14143.44, i assume like these actors that i've quoted you would have seen this happen over and over and over
14148.08, again and she would have heard this and had it and is confirming that these are the checks that
14152.64, exist and these are also the same checks that existed on the rest set i mean you can say that
14158.0, this is nothing and that's fine we can move on from this and say it's nothing i don't think i think
14163.36, this points to the fact or the potential fact that this was likely similar to most other sets with
14170.4, their rules and perhaps like it could be possible she's just talking out of her ass maybe that's the
14176.8, case either way that doesn't change the reality that gun safety issues existed on set and were
14183.359999999999, violated at some point sure that issue is getting from the wider question so hold on first of all
14187.84, no obfuscations happening okay that's we're just having a conversation we can't talk about all
14192.0, topics simultaneously because we're not artificial intelligence okay so the only reason why i'm bringing
14196.72, this up is because a lot of people are incredibly eager to assign either a small or a huge level of
14202.0, responsibility to Alec Baldwin for reasons okay now all i've said is that i think that this is one
14208.72, of the rare cases where a gun accident has happened okay something something happened that involved
14213.76, the negligent discharging firearm but we're probably going to get all the details about what happened
14217.52, because it was on a fucking movie set there's tons of witnesses there's a lot of people around
14220.88, there might even film role who the fuck knows right so it seems silly to me for people to come
14225.2, out and say this is what the procedures were when we don't know what the procedures were
14228.32, this is who's at fault when it's like we don't 100 know who's at fault people seem very eager
14232.08, to assign blame when we go wait a couple weeks and let more details come up from the case it's like
14236.0, oh okay well it was this because i think that my argument is that there are so many branching paths
14241.279999999999, where in some worlds Alec Baldwin absolutely could have prevented this from happening and there are
14246.08, other worlds where Alec Baldwin absolutely should not have been involved in clearing a firearm so it
14250.64, was 100% the responsibility of like a shared response between like the armor and the assistant director
14255.12, though either of those could be the case but without knowing the exact rules that were on this set
14260.0, it's hard to make that declaration or there could be like a broader responsibility of the producers
14264.800000000001, because there was live ammunition on set when there shouldn't have been or something like that
14267.76, that's all i'm saying i just i find it weird that people are jumping to trying to assign levels or
14272.640000000001, degrees of blame to people by saying well in other movies they've done this when it's like okay why
14276.160000000002, don't we just wait till we find out what the exact rules were on this set like i think it's fair to say
14283.04, you know we should wait for more information but to say like there is no like even potential
14289.28, conclusions we can lean towards right now when we actually do have a lot of information available
14294.800000000001, we have the general guidelines we have the comments by other actors we have the incident details
14300.320000000002, by the police right now we know something has gone wrong with firearm safety we have the statements
14305.2, by crew that were there we have the fact that people were saying they were cutting corners on
14309.84, the production um you know we we know a lot of stuff and we have a lot to go off right now yes
14315.6, there will be more and i am not going to sit here and at no point have i sat here and said
14320.4, Alec Baldwin is solely responsible and needs to go to jail he is a murderer i think statements of
14325.52, that to that effect are absurd right sure so i don't i don't know that yet what i do know is we know
14332.08, for the fact that at some point firearm safety was violated and i am of the belief that one of the
14338.16, rules as it appears right now based on the information provided is that there are multiple people that
14343.68, are supposed to check that gun yeah but even if that is not the case and there is a weird exception
14348.48, for the rest set you still have other guidelines that were violated both by production managers
14354.72, and by the people on the ground handling the gun okay so here here is here so um we'll see
14362.72, okay let's test this okay so here is what i'm saying okay there are worlds so let me give a
14368.72, let me give a sample policy okay a firearm is supposed to be cleared by the armor then handed to
14376.48, the um then handed to the um assistant director and then cleared again and then handed to an actor
14382.48, okay if that was the procedure if if if if if if if i'm not saying that is but if that is the
14388.32, procedure okay if the ad said the gun was clear handed it to the actor and then the actor fired
14394.24, and killed somebody okay let's say that the armor never touched that gun in that case i would say
14399.76, that the almost the sole responsibility of that incident falls on the assistant director at in
14404.8, that hypothetical would you agree or disagree with that it that's that's tough because there if i
14412.48, would almost say that could partially also beyond the production and whoever put forward the safety
14418.8, rules because you're supposed to have more safety rules in place as established by the film studios
14423.92, and labor unions which you know if you look at the union guidelines it's if you're firing a weapon
14428.56, towards people or towards the gun first of all don't fire it we'd recommend or suggest that you
14433.92, use a fake gun instead and use CGI okay hold on wait this is all not relevant i'm saying this is i'm
14439.12, saying that in that case i understand if those were the rules on set but i would say even so those
14444.640000000001, seem like bad rules okay obviously let's say those let's say those are the rules on set okay
14450.880000000001, if the rule on set is that the armor checks it and clears it then the um ad checks it and clears it
14456.800000000001, and then they give the gun to the actors not supposed to and they say it's clear in the actor fires
14461.36, in that case with the with the which we agree that the sole responsibility lives on the assistant
14465.12, director it within the confines of their rules yes but on a wider analysis i would say that those
14475.28, are bad rules okay sure that's right that's not part of the item is that it's that in that hypothetical
14479.52, okay let's say that there is a rule that the armor checks and clears the gun and that the ad checks
14485.36, and clears the gun but there's a rule on set that if you're handed a firearm you're supposed to observe
14489.76, it being checked and clear it before it's handed off to you and then you sign off on it kind of like
14493.04, with a rental car right let's say that that happens okay let's say that the armor never turns
14497.68, into the ad just picks it up and then they say it's clear and they give it to an actor all right
14501.2, if that was the case then could we agree that there is a shared responsibility there between the actor
14506.240000000002, and the assistant director did we agree with that i mean sure but like to me if the rules on set are
14513.28, obviously lacking and you know this is something someone in my chat is pointing out this doesn't
14517.28, absolve any one of moral responsibility it doesn't absolve any one of what they should or probably
14522.16, should do like okay okay okay you're suggesting world to which rules are very bad no no i'm just
14527.2, i'm trying to make you understand something no no no hold on hold on let me let me okay if you ever
14530.88, confused about like a chain of commander why things are the way they are it was one where we have
14533.84, human okay liability okay let's say that you're on a set and let's say that ultimately if anything
14538.24, bad happened no no why the ability so so let's say that anything that happens with a firearm okay
14542.4, is ultimately the liability of the armor let's say that that is the case okay let's say that any any
14547.36, criminal civil charges whatever production like a liability like in terms of monetary damage let's
14551.6, say it rests on like the armor or the armor and the assistant director if that was the case and if
14556.4, they are trained and that's the case don't you think it might be fair for them to say if we check
14560.880000000001, and clear a gun between the two of us and we're the ones that ultimately the liability when we give
14565.04, you that gun you don't do anything with it except what we tell you to which is pull the trigger you
14569.36, don't empty the mag you don't play with the bullets you don't spin it you do you get that gun exact
14573.28, right don't you think it's fair for them to say in that case we don't want an actor without the
14577.52, proper firearm training that we have to be messing with that firearm if we clear it and give it to him
14581.68, then he touches it as is and that's it do you think that might be fair for them to say within
14586.560000000001, that hypothetical and if you know that was the rules on the rest set i can agree that within a
14592.720000000001, legal court you know that's why i'm not going to make any assessment or judge whether Alec Baldwin
14597.84, or anyone is going to be charged with anything that's going to depend on the specifics but
14602.8, from and you know from the information available on Hollywood standards on everything else
14608.72, it these and just general understanding of guns i i think we can still say there's gun safety
14615.119999999999, issues here whether liability aside sure so well so liabilities is paramount is incredibly
14622.16, important maybe the most important thing okay number one number two a general understanding
14626.32, of guns doesn't apply here because actors are using these in a in a highly unique situation that
14630.56, almost no other person should ever be using a firearm as and broader Hollywood standards
14635.199999999999, aren't really relevant unless you want to back up and say should there have been different rules
14638.4, on set which is okay but this isn't even controversial everyone that has been coming out that worked
14644.24, on the rest set and everyone around it is saying that there is a problem with the production
14648.16, company and the safety rules they had in place that they weren't following their own safety rules
14652.72, they we already know they weren't following basic things by having lied ammunition on their set in
14658.16, the first place in holy shit it ends up being the case that they were actually doing you know
14663.28, they were going out and yep that's going to be nuts right sure so you're doing this thing where
14668.88, i'm trying to have a conversation around safety issue okay i don't okay i'm trying to connect
14673.52, with you okay i don't know if you could tell you doing this i'm trying to have a specific conversation
14676.48, one thing and every time you talk you're vomiting out like 15 peripheral pieces of information that
14682.8, aren't relevant to the one thing i'm discussing as an attempt to build an argument when i'm just
14686.4, trying to hone in on like one or two different things like was it the case that there were
14690.8, potentially people using live ammunition on set yes live ammunition was recovered on set which is
14695.119999999999, obviously fucked up right there are also two prior negligent discharges already in this production
14700.16, which in my opinion music should have been shut down right there are there are other things that
14703.84, we can bring in but that's not related to the specific things i'm asking all i'm trying to say
14708.0, is that there are possible worlds where where the actor himself had almost no responsibility
14714.56, and there are also possible worlds where the actor himself actually had on a macro level a
14718.96, great level of responsibility because he should have canceled the reduction or got a new company
14722.24, and two might have been maybe required to personally check the firearm i'm just saying that there are
14726.56, multiple possible worlds here and there's no reason to try to say this should happen or that should
14731.439999999999, happen or this person fucked up or that person fucked up until we have like a little bit more
14734.8, information that comes out now i know it's not as fun or sexy to talk about stories like when
14738.4, there are three or four or five weeks old it just seems really weird to try to jump in and pull in
14742.08, a ton of random information to build a case we don't have all the facts yet and we're going to get them
14746.32, listen i i don't disagree with you that they're like like you said there are possible worlds where
14751.36, that could happen where anything could happen but based on the current information we have available
14757.2, i think you know it's very unlikely that there is a situation in which the producers in which
14763.28, bollman was one of them has no blame whether that be on a legal or immoral level and not that i
14770.72, even want to apply blame like i think it was a horrific situation overall and you know i don't
14776.72, think baldwin had any intentions of hurting anyone in this situation but even even people on his set
14782.8, had said like the conditions were were not good they were cutting corners the first armor
14788.48, wait do you know why they said they were cutting corners and the conditions weren't good
14792.56, there were multiple reasons yeah some of them were housing yes okay some of them were safety
14795.84, some of them were covid yep okay just making sure because we keep saying this because a lot of
14799.04, people say this there was a ton of safety issues there were a couple safety issues but there were
14802.160000000002, a whole broader set of things as well and they brought in i think they brought in different people
14805.44, to do some of the production afterwards because some people walked off non-union yeah non-union
14809.84, people um and it's well like it doesn't even matter if it's a broad amount of people the
14814.400000000001, fact that there was issues around guns and weaponry in general is is obviously the primary concern
14819.44, here um the original armor they tried to hire for the for the production refused to do it because
14826.08, they didn't want to give him a second to work with him to check you know to ensure he let he wants to
14832.64, when he does a production have a second to double check everything he does to make it safe and he
14836.4, said there was a red flag that they didn't want to do that that they wanted to cut that corner so
14840.88, you know what even even if there is no level liability for the production company i think on a public
14847.12, level looking at the information we have available you can say there's a bit of a moral question of
14852.08, wow there were some serious corners cut here that could have potentially prevented this from happening
14858.48, had you not cut those corners and whether people like or hate Baldwin doesn't matter he was a producer
14864.24, on this production that is true but ultimately we are not going to be able to say more until more
14871.68, information comes out even when we say that he's a producer they don't really know what that means
14875.68, was he actually a producer that was involved in making like really high level decisions
14880.08, or related to the production or was he like an actor out as a producer because it happens
14884.0, sometimes because they get either more credits or whatever shit like that right we just don't
14887.36, know the answer to these questions yet some of the things we do know you're right some we don't but
14897.84, it's all pointing in one direction very confidently and every time more information
14903.039999999999, what is the one direction what do you mean when you say that that there was serious corner cutting
14907.36, on this set that I agree with that yeah that does see that there were gun issues on this set yeah
14912.800000000001, that's a greeble yes I just don't understand people that are coming out so hardcore like
14922.800000000001, you know against people suggesting this was a gun safety issue against people suggesting there
14927.28, may be some culpability with Baldwin being a part of the action so yeah so there's like two
14932.64, these are two totally many things was there a gun safety issue absolutely three negligent
14937.119999999999, discharges on a set is unbelievable that's unreal to me that's un this is the third one that's
14941.439999999999, unbelievable so obviously there were gun safety issues but the only question is is who was the
14945.92, one ultimately responsible we don't know that right let's say for instance because it's possible
14951.199999999999, but we don't know this but it's possible that two days from now an email gets leaked and
14956.64, Alec Baldwin is talking to the the actual producer and he's saying hey listen I know that there were a
14962.48, couple of fuckups on set or whatever I think it's fine let's just like you know trooper through
14965.68, like who cares nothing happened or whatever if that came out then it seems like Alec Baldwin is
14970.16, pretty culpable for additional safety mishaps including his negligent discharge right
14977.119999999999, yeah I mean that would be like obviously the day on the caution kind of yeah for sure let's say
14982.0, that it comes out that there was an email where he says hey listen we've had two accidents on set
14987.6, already we need to get a new armor this is insane this isn't safe and the guy responds back and
14992.64, he's and the other producer responds back and he says listen we don't have the money from the
14996.24, production company to do this if you want to get a new set or whatever like the movie is going to
15000.4, be canceled every single employee here is going home and you just fucked you know 200 people out
15004.88, of a job or however many people are working on this set so you know in that case I mean like he
15010.08, still you try to bring the attention maybe he does like but now the liability shifted a lot more to
15013.6, the producer do the other producer do you agree that that's possible like I would never disagree
15018.8, at any point that that multiple people can have degrees of responsibility that's not what I'm asking
15023.2, you I know I didn't ask you hold on you totally just you danced around that beautifully okay that
15027.12, was nice I wasn't right you absolutely you gave me the most political non-answer in the world of
15031.6, course varying people because when I asked you before when I asked you were the one was Alec Baldwin
15035.68, was the bad guy you were like half fuck yeah that would absolutely incriminate him but then when I
15039.2, gave you the opposite we were like well yeah different people gonna have varying levels of
15041.92, responsibility depending upon how culpable they were for setting up the right you totally do answer
15045.68, right hey so so fine but these are all still hypotheticals based on the real information we have it is
15052.08, all pointing in one direction no no the direction that it's pointing at is just that there were gun
15057.6, safety issues absolutely but we don't have an individual where we can be like it was that mother
15062.800000000001, fuckers fault are we gonna sign a high level of where have I said in this conversation it is that
15067.76, mother fuckers fault so like you're accusing me of you've spent so much time accusing me of laurin
15073.76, you misfertre the other side's conversation you exaggerated you're doing that right now I have
15078.72, not said at any point it's that mother fuckers fault oh okay okay wait okay okay okay okay you
15084.48, can shut down my bad faith inquiry right now then so I'm just asking this question so do you think
15088.08, that it's plausible that Alec Baldwin either could or could not have almost any culpability in terms
15092.8, of what happened I think that would be strange based on the information now but yes it's possible
15099.84, okay that's okay it would be very strange based on the information we okay that's great that's all
15104.48, I need okay when breaking news stories come out all I need is for people to acknowledge like it is
15109.279999999999, possible there could be some emails leaked that actually totally changed who we would consider
15113.92, to be more culpable here like I said before there could be emails to come out where it's like Alec
15117.2, Baldwin 100 rush this fucked it up allowed dangerous conditions to exist on set and there could be
15123.28, other emails that almost exonerate and we're he's saying like hey we need to do something about
15126.480000000001, this like okay like you've you we've gone through the procedures of this we have like a sit down
15129.92, and talk everybody maybe they try his best to like everything's changed and then nothing did pan
15133.2, out or whatever right that both of these worlds are still both very possible it's not all the
15137.2, evidence is pointing one direction bullshit we have very little evidence we don't know about
15140.240000000002, you right now both of these worlds are very possible I think that it's plausible but based on the
15146.72, information we have right now the set seemed like a disaster we've got who's fault was that though
15152.32, the topic saying that gun safety was clearly not followed why do you keep repeating we know that
15157.039999999999, gun safety wasn't followed somebody got shot I don't need you to say we know that gun safety
15160.4, was a follow somebody got shot you don't need to keep repeating that point we don't need gun
15163.279999999999, experts saying that obviously somebody got shot some safety procedure was a fault you don't need
15166.32, to keep repeating that okay the question isn't whether gun safety was or wasn't followed the
15170.24, question is is who is ultimately culpable for it that's what people want to know we're not
15173.68, having it's going to be one individual I don't think that I think it's going to be a I think
15178.880000000001, everyone on that set who knew people were using the prop weapons for plinking on the side
15184.56, if that comes out to be confirmed is probably has a bit of responsibility right would you agree with
15190.24, that um I don't know how much they're expected to know that feels like it would almost be common
15194.720000000001, sense to me but I could probably agree that a little bit yeah yeah so I think that there could
15198.8, be a lot of people potentially I really I think it's unlikely that it is going to be one smoking
15205.279999999999, gun email that comes out like ha ha you know I I loaded the gun or we should we should fire all
15211.679999999998, of this staff for safe that are you know controlling safety measures like I don't think that's going
15216.56, to be the case and you know you can say that I'm making assumptions but I'd like to think that
15221.92, I've read a lot of the content on this and at least the assumptions I'm making are educated ones
15228.48, on the situation based on what we have so far and you know what I think it's actually fair of you
15232.24, too to say you should still wait for more but sure and in every article that I've read about this
15238.4, thus far now I haven't seen with the location this is whatever person said but in every article
15242.48, I've read so far every single statement said that the protocol on this set was that the armorer was
15247.439999999999, supposed to clear the gun and then it was supposed to hit it off to the ad that also clears the gun
15251.68, that checks and clears the gun and that from there it was supposed to be declared hot or cold and
15255.12, then given to the actor basically that that was like the procedure that they had on set if that is
15259.04, the case and the actor isn't supposed to clear it then in that like microcosm of a scenario then
15264.560000000001, from everything I've seen so far it seems like the assistant director is almost completely at fault
15269.12, here because they didn't get it from the armor they picked a gun up off a table that wasn't locked
15272.720000000001, up which is super fucked and they didn't even clear the fucking weapon or if they did they did a
15276.960000000001, really poor job of doing so if that is the case but now I'm not going to say it's only the 80s well
15281.92, because there could be other worlds where Alec Baldwin maybe should have had more of a hand in it
15286.16, or he could have asked I don't know if he should ask if like the armor checkers the ad should be
15289.76, doing that or maybe the armorer is at fault because they didn't lock the guns up or maybe Alec is
15293.04, at fault because he knew that there were problems on set before and he wasn't changing the safety
15295.92, procedures it clearly weren't working all of these things are possible but all we know is that like
15299.84, something fucked up obviously it was really bad we don't know what the exact procedures were
15303.52, on set so it's hard to sign up blame to an individual but this all information is all going to come
15307.2, out as the case comes out it's absolutely going to be because people are going to be fighting over
15310.08, who's liable because that's where the like the manslaughter charges and shit are probably going
15312.88, to land right yeah and you know that assistant director I don't know if you read this but he had
15317.84, actually apparently had this situation happen to him on a set in 2019 where a sound guy was injured
15324.16, in a in a discharge of the weapon and and the set there to me did the proper thing they fired
15330.56, everyone they fired him immediately with just one circumstance like that so you've already you
15336.24, know I started this as well but the first two discharges or misfires the media have been using
15341.76, the terms interchangeably which is confusing me but I assume they mean discharges like mistake
15347.92, in ones with when those two happen yeah they should have shut it down then and done a whole
15353.039999999999, inquiry into it so I did want to ask because I don't think we actually disagree on too much I think
15358.96, I just see more probability and more I think that the media that has come out so far
15365.52, has shown more certain problems than you believe that level of certainty is it should be applied to it
15374.0, I haven't seen anything and you absolutely haven't provided anything that incriminates one character
15379.76, more than anybody else other than this statement from I'm not trying to incriminate one character
15384.24, more than other people I'm sure I've been putting if you're just information forward that actors
15389.92, experts the union guidelines say and saying this is it's looking like this is what should have been
15395.68, followed on the set and it wasn't I'm not trying to say Alec Baldwin big bad liberal he is he is
15402.24, entirely culpable for this I'm saying wow he was a producer on this film and it looks like quarters
15409.36, were cut that's probably a lot more people than just Baldwin probably not even you know it's probably
15414.08, not even 50% him it's probably just a smaller percentage than that depending on what he was
15418.72, personally signing off on right now it's looking like it's leaning towards you know it was his job to
15426.0, to check the gun as well that seems pretty standard at the moment perhaps you'll be right and it'll
15430.8, come out that or your assumption that this is a possibility could be right and it'll come out
15435.599999999999, that it was absolutely not his job at all that could be true I just don't think I think that
15440.72, it's plausible but unlikely okay so and then just real quick because I know that you were
15445.92, quoting that in just there was like an industry wide labor management safety committee did anything
15449.84, in there say that actors typically clear or check firearms here I can open it right now well even
15458.960000000001, have you read the they were not following any of the things in there like wearing a safety gear
15464.72, and everything I'll bring it up and well the but why weren't they wearing safety gear
15469.44, what do you mean why weren't they wearing safety gear they probably weren't wearing safety gear
15473.12, because they thought that the the rounds were were dummy rounds right that's that's the guideline
15477.76, for blank for blank for blank amin a way wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait okay
15480.560000000001, hold on real quick I could be wrong okay I'm just going to explain these three things you tell me
15483.76, wrong okay my understanding is that a dummy round is a normal cartridge with a projectile on the end
15489.36, but the cartridge has BBs in it and the primer is dead so when you pull the trigger nothing
15493.68, happens that's a dummy round a blank round is around where the primer is active there is a
15499.44, squib load at the top it's pinched off and there's like paper or something and there's gunpowder so
15503.44, when you pull the trigger there will be a flash the action will cycle and the cartridge will be
15507.84, ejected and then a live round is like we would say colloquially a live round has a projectile it's
15511.68, a full like bullet or whatever but you shouldn't kill somebody with right so if they thought that
15516.16, these rounds were I believe dummy rounds then they were not using protective equipment because
15520.4, when you pull the trigger nothing should happen so of course they're not using for that let me
15524.0, just read the right let me just read the opening here it says these guidelines are intended to
15528.0, give recommendations and I acknowledge its recommendations so I see that on the safe handling use and
15533.68, storage of firearms firearms include prop guns rubber guns plastic guns non guns flint
15539.44, block guns pistols machine guns rifles and shotguns that shoot blank ammunition so you're
15544.08, right this is the guideline for blank ammunition so I wonder if it does say anything about dummy
15548.72, rounds in here well I we don't have to go through I mean we'll know this right that like
15557.76, a dummy round there's probably not going to be protection because nothing is coming out of the
15561.52, gun when you fire a dummy round for blanks there will absolutely be protection because people
15565.6, can be killed there can be some some stuff can come emitted like dummy shit stuff but yeah go ahead
15572.0, okay sorry sorry yeah yeah so like they give you guidelines for firearms that can fire just blank
15578.56, ammunition yeah that's my guess yeah yeah and they can be guidelines for guns that can fire real
15583.04, ammunition as well so it seems like just the capability to do it is what the guideline is for
15588.480000000001, so even if it doesn't have them in it well my so my this is my guess if you can find something
15593.12, here that contradicts me tell me if you're firing if you're doing a scene where you're firing blanks
15598.080000000002, there's probably some level of PPE required there but if you're doing a scene where you're firing
15603.84, dummy rounds probably not that would be my guess yeah right okay so I think that's fair but yeah it
15610.08, does say you have to have PPE for blanks it does say you know yeah all of these guidelines were
15617.28, obviously not followed in this circumstance but either way you know there was live ammo on set so
15624.96, it almost doesn't matter because the cardinal principle of all of this was not followed well
15629.44, sure you probably should never have live ammo on set unless you're literally filming like a
15632.96, fucking documentary on shooting like ball but I will say I know there have been movie scenes
15638.4, where they have filmed the gun firing um and then like an actor shooting it and then they filmed
15646.32, like the side of a car having it be hit with real ammunition you know but everything's set up
15652.72, properly so they have used scenes with live ammunition before which is why there's live ammunition
15657.52, guidelines with the actors guild but I think from what I understand this is where it's so complex
15662.8, is like if you're not doing something like that which is an extreme exception there should never
15668.24, be live ammunition on set especially when you're mixing up those guns with for sure and even if
15673.84, you want to take it and honestly it sounds a little crazy but even if there was live ammunition on
15679.68, set that shouldn't be a problem because there should be at least two highly qualified people
15685.28, manually inspected the firearm before any scene the armor and the AD or the prop master whoever's
15691.44, handing it off should be manually inspecting these firearms before they're given even if there was
15695.04, live ammunition set should never make its way into the barrel of a firearm that's going to be
15699.68, like used for a scene right so I think one thing that can we agree on this at least that and you
15705.36, know this is a weird argument for me as a as a conservative to be making but there should be more
15711.84, these guidelines that are suggestions should probably be standard rules and not just suggestions on
15718.400000000001, sets right can we agree on maybe that not really I think that for the most part it seems like gun
15723.92, safety on sets has like been pretty stringently followed this was just like an exceptional case
15727.84, of like people being incredibly reckless like such that if these were rules I don't know if it would
15732.72, have changed anything just in my personal no movie experience or whatever if I was working
15738.08, something and a single negligent discharge happened I would probably fire everybody involved and I
15742.0, would get a totally different group just one there should never ever ever ever ever happen
15745.44, where negligent discharges is defined as a firearm fired a projectile that wasn't supposed to you
15750.24, would never get a second chance of that a third I would assume your suicidal and I would just ask
15754.16, you to go do your business offset instead of getting other people involved that's insane to me but
15758.16, like if you have a set where the production has reached that level where you had three negligent
15762.08, discharges over the course of filming one fucking movie I don't know of these being fucking federal
15766.32, codified laws okay that the queen of England herself came over and fucking enforced with a sword
15770.56, would have made a difference to these people that so it just seems to be the case like in the US
15774.88, we have fuck tons of shows and movies that are filming with like cops and guns and all the
15778.56, shit all the time and it seems exceptionally rare that these types of issues happen so
15782.88, the set must have been exceptionally poorly managed for it to happen multiple times well
15787.199999999999, like I almost wonder now though after looking into this if it's just we don't hear about these
15791.519999999999, issues because these companies have like massive I don't know so like that issue in 2019 where the
15798.96, sound guy was hurt because of a discharge by this guy who is now feeling the rest of the
15804.8, ad you ever hear about that and it didn't want to make changes hold on I'm just fucking Christ
15811.119999999999, sorry sorry wait wait wait wait can you repeat that again something just put an ad in my fucking
15814.96, window okay say what you just said again sorry so like I almost wonder though if this happens more
15819.439999999999, often than we think because first of all before the actual shooting of Hutchins there was the two
15827.359999999999, discharges on sets that neither of us none of us knew about that wasn't in the media obviously
15833.12, there was this situation in 2019 with the ad where he was fired from a set for another negligent
15841.44, discharge of a gun that injured someone and these weren't massive things in the media I was reading
15846.08, another article from 2017 where a stuntman died on a scene that they were filming for Bliss and
15853.84, Esso video in Brisbane he died from a blank a gun loaded with blanks the blank apparently
15860.08, or was it the blank I love to check again but um yeah it's supposed to be a gun with blanks so these
15865.92, are cases that I have never heard of in my life so I'm almost wondering if it isn't as uncommon
15870.56, as we think it is I would my guess would be is that it's super uncommon and the reason isn't
15876.32, whether it's get what's reported on or not but like at least in the United States I think the
15881.12, the screen actor scaled whatever these people have a lot of power and I don't think that they would
15884.8, stand for these conditions on set I feel like there would be a huge snake made about them
15888.64, and then especially today where like everybody's got like cell phones and social media and shit
15893.279999999999, like these things probably do get reported but like nobody cares much about it but you can go back
15898.08, and like look for stories about this that would be my guess I guess it's possible in some cases
15902.16, where in a very small set maybe it happens or whatever but it just it seems like there would be
15907.199999999999, so many more accidents especially because there are so many mainstream productions in the US
15910.64, and of all the use of firearms yeah but you know like you said you know people wouldn't stand for
15916.72, that it seems like the one thing standing in the way of this happening more and not happening is
15922.4, the immaculate standards or like the massive standards that these these sets have and which
15928.08, I'm reading about our standard on with other you know companies armorers and actors sure just to
15935.76, be clear and that in this like thing that you were citing you because you froze up a few times
15939.92, the industry wide labor management safety standards I don't think anything in here shows of anything
15943.76, about like an actor themselves clearing a firearm seems to all point back to like property master
15949.28, the prop master or the armor themselves it doesn't seem like an actor is ever involved or at least
15954.24, I haven't seen any of these things yeah it isn't in the actors guidelines what I was those are more
15960.56, the PPE and you know not pointing it anyone blanks can kill for the showing everyone that it's clear
15966.96, I quoted the actors and the company that does fire arm rentals to set movie sets there are also a
15974.48, few armorers who have said this as well I've shown up the articles for you okay um and then oh and
15980.64, then another thing somebody might try to spread this up we do hear all the time on sets when like
15984.24, stuntmen are injured and stuff so it seems like if these firearm things are going off a lot we'd
15987.439999999999, probably get because I feel like I've heard like somebody you know like Tom Cruise broke his leg
15991.439999999999, that doesn't count but like a stuntman was injured so it like delays like the film and
15994.32, whatever it seems like these things get reported on at least if the movie is big enough maybe there's
15997.52, a bunch of smaller movies where it happens and we don't hear about it but yeah I have no idea how
16000.88, common is that was just a random thought I was putting out like oh my gosh like because I don't
16005.119999999999, like I did had no idea about that discharge that happened with the ad this is not something I think
16011.119999999999, about I don't hear about it that often people getting shot on movie sets um so I was like is it
16016.96, is it that common how would this happen I have no idea how common it would be or how uncommon but
16021.2, like you're saying it's probably very uncommon based on the fact that we hear about it so little
16026.960000000001, but if so it's probably because there are extreme guidelines for how they're supposed to do these
16030.720000000001, things sure I would assume when you say I'm curious when you say yeah when you say make a new standard
16039.12, what kind of enforceability you're looking for that I'm curious what you mean by that
16042.480000000001, auto just because right now all of the articles reporting on this one of the biggest difficulties
16047.2, talking about it is there's there's no set standard it's just the states or whoever is talking about
16054.400000000001, it you know they whatever the guidelines are for the labor union whatever the guidelines are for
16060.560000000001, the specific set so it seems weird to me and I'm not a legislator but it seems weird to me that
16066.08, there isn't like a set expectation for how firearms should be handled on movie sets wait so do you
16072.400000000001, think there should be like legal standards for it or I'm just curious what you mean when you say
16076.0, standards I don't know it just seems weird to me I that there isn't like yes across the board set
16083.04, expectation for and protocol to prevent these things from happening okay maybe I'm wrong I don't
16090.32, know maybe there shouldn't be it just seems weird to just any I'm just carried whenever somebody says
16095.2, like well because that's like a question I asked people to be like oh well this shouldn't um
16098.16, or you can even say it with regards to like a haban tai like the the coronavirus uh vaccine
16102.48, mandates right they should be mandated when somebody says that you have to ask them like should the
16106.24, government mandate it should private companies mandate it should schools because these are all
16109.039999999999, different so like when you say like should there be it like mandates or standard set are you saying
16113.119999999999, that like it should be included as part of like the insurance policies or like their labor contracts
16117.6, or there should be like a special set of laws drafted in states for like firearms used in
16121.359999999999, productions I was just curious it's not a huge question I was just curious if you had like something
16124.88, yeah no I I haven't thought about it that like that hard about how it would exactly be implemented
16131.28, it just seems strange to me that even yeah even the media commentators everyone is having difficulty
16137.52, painting down the policies around this which seems to have added to to confusion about
16144.640000000001, yeah how firearms are supposed to be run on sets um and I'm sure that would lead to confusion with
16149.68, people working on these sets and seeing things going on like oh are they allowed to be
16154.480000000001, blinking on the side is that is that okay on sets if there's no you know official standard it seems
16160.32, like people that have spent a long time in the industry like this armorer who initially turned
16163.84, down the job is like this is not normal and I'm not going to be anywhere near this and union crews
16169.199999999999, who for plenty of reasons walked off and were like we know this isn't normal and we're not going to
16173.44, come near this but for people that they just brought on like they said they brought on non-unitized
16177.92, individuals to save money and cut corners they might be like well there's no you know set standard
16183.44, available I guess that all of this weirdness going on around me these misfires uh this negligent
16189.76, negligent discharges I guess is there somewhere we can report that maybe it's normal I don't know
16195.76, um I I'm not the expert here but it does seem that that could be an issue like I said perhaps
16201.92, I'm wrong okay all right well anything else I don't think we entirely disagree here like I said
16211.2, it's just um no we do to be clear when I all right I see a breaking news story okay the only issue I
16218.800000000001, have is that if there could be other possibilities and if there's more evidence coming out I just
16224.320000000002, hate it when people try to hijack it to like push their own narrative as quickly as possible so for
16229.28, instance like every single time there's a mass shooting okay all the conservatives are praying to
16234.0, God that it's a brown dude in a hijab and all the people on the left are praying to God that it's
16237.92, some you know white in cell kid like everybody is like hoping immediately to jump behind and we saw
16242.72, Trump jump on this I'm sure we've seen liberals jump on this where it's you know like a shooting
16246.16, happens I was like oh it was a goddamn terrorist like oh fuck it wasn't or like oh my god it was a
16250.16, um you know this and it's like oh fuck no it wasn't that and then it like it looks really bad I just
16253.04, wish people just like chill for like two seconds before so information comes out I think that it's
16257.28, totally fair and I think it's totally appropriate to say there were some huge safety fuck-ups on this
16262.48, set absolutely I just don't know who to point the finger at yet that's all I'm saying and it could be
16266.88, it and because people think I'm sitting for Baldwin it could be 100% Baldwin's fault and you know what
16272.24, as the like executive or not associate producer whatever you call it or co-produce whatever there
16276.4, is like a decent likelihood that at some point even if it wasn't directly in that micro interaction
16281.359999999999, at some point he maybe he did have a larger voice to stop something especially because he's a big
16285.279999999999, fucking name he probably carries a lot of weight behind what he says even if the even if he isn't
16288.8, the actual like associate producer or whatever even if you even if he is just in there in name
16293.92, only he's a huge fucking actor so that could be the case but I'm just saying like chill a little
16298.64, information because that's all I think there's it so I agree with that phenomenon that exists
16302.8, where it's like oh please let the shooter be white please let the shooter be proud of the
16306.72, Vantepa like that of course exists but there's also another phenomenon that happens where something
16312.08, will happen and it doesn't turn out the way the individual wants and it's like oh shit the shooter
16317.84, was a white person and suddenly they come in and they're like we don't have all the information yet
16323.44, we don't have all the facts everyone settle down everyone chill and adds more information comes out
16328.880000000001, every person on set is speaking up everyone all these industry giants are saying this is not normal
16335.92, you know to continue to say we've just got to wait for more info we just got to wait for more
16340.960000000001, info we just can't know we can't know anything we don't know where it's pointing like I think that
16345.28, is another phenomenon that people follow when they're simping for one person that is but it sounded
16350.96, suspiciously similar to this information to this scenario but none of that has happened yet yeah
16355.679999999998, okay the property manager is not the expert on set that you think they are okay that is
16360.0, absolutely there's a reason why that person is only quoted the fucking New York Post okay I'm sorry
16363.759999999998, the property manager is not the one that we're interested in here number one and number two
16367.039999999999, all of the information will come out on this nobody can hide from it the most progressive BLM
16372.32, zesar pronoun liberal cannot hide from the truth of this case because it will come out of
16375.92, charges we filed and the most conservative right wing the thin blue line you know cop lives matter
16382.08, whatever person will not be able to hide from the truth in this it's not one of those things where
16385.2, we can all be like oh we don't know we will know all the information and when it might come out and
16388.48, who knows who will be liable but to say chill that's nobody knows it's not pointing in any
16392.88, direction i didn't say it wasn't pointing in the direction listen i know that in Canada things are
16397.76, different but in the United States we have a legal concept called anacinital proven guilty and
16401.6, that concept can be more broadly applied when it comes to conversations in society i guarantee you
16406.399999999998, i would bet my life on it that you've probably tweeted at least one time in your life that oh my
16411.519999999997, god this me too stuff is crazy like you can just get accused as a man and even if there is a lot of
16415.76, information one direction there should at least be a trial something i'm sure you said that at least
16418.719999999998, once in your life and i'm saying that exact same standard to probably apply here especially when
16421.84, we know we're going to get all the evidence there's no reason i have never said at one point there
16426.56, should not be a trial i have never said someone is 100% guilty i have said there is a lot of information
16432.0, that is leading in one direction right now but of course innocent until proven guilty 100%
16435.920000000002, agree with that absolutely all right speaking of what do you think of the written house
16441.280000000002, stuff coming up um i don't think about it that much i think it's probably going to end in a
16445.120000000003, super predictable manner we'll just see how many uh riots are i guess or if i get pinned on like
16449.52, smaller charges like i don't even know if the firearm possession is illegal at this point or if
16453.2, they got that kicked out because of the hunting shit or whatever what do you um there was just the
16459.04, incident the other day where everyone was freaking out because the judge was saying you can't um
16464.72, we can't necessarily refer to the people who were shot as victims yet well of course because
16469.52, that's fucking material to the case or their victims then written house is guilty if they're
16473.280000000002, aggressors that he defended so then they're not good why would you be able to call them victims
16476.8, that doesn't make any sense that's literally the subject matter of the the case that's not
16480.0, surprising to me at all yeah yeah right yeah people were saying it was an indication of uh
16484.8, bias with the judge but yeah that's pretty okay all right well that's all i had for tonight
16491.76, okay i enjoyed the talk have fun be careful stay safe um yeah i'll see you later but wait wait
16500.0, oh yeah okay what now you had your first zirker royale experience how to echo
16505.52, i was supposed to stream on Thursday and Friday yesterday i did zircon Wednesday and i just uh
16513.28, i chose not to i almost quit twitch all together it gave me a severe existential crisis jesus i
16519.84, don't know like what is what is the purpose of it what is the meaning i mean i come out and ask
16528.4, that question is absurdist have dealt with this for many years what is the meaning of life and i
16532.4, think when you go on podcast like that you quickly find out that sometimes existence is
16536.32, aimless and meaningless and you just got to push the boulder up the hill and how long did you push
16540.16, the boulder for how long were you on that podcast for it how long did you last i i was uh dealing
16546.640000000003, with the raucousisophis for at least three hours or four hours or something i quit because they
16550.88, wouldn't ban people he he never actually oh like in chatter like on the show so he said that i had
16558.24, been entertaining or something so he had granted me the right to ban someone so i did and i'm like
16562.960000000003, thank god there's like 700 people talking here and then he just invited them back and he kept saying
16567.920000000002, we were gonna ban people i don't know how you have a conversation with 70 people at the same time
16573.68, yeah if you've ever seen on my channel anybody should there's like a lot of people to do panels
16577.36, with like 10 people and it'll just be screaming the entire time and whoever has the louder mic or
16582.320000000003, the more gain or whatever basically gets through it's exhausting there was literally a chick there
16586.72, who was just in a party and there were like random people sitting on a couch all together
16590.800000000003, standing up and joining and i'm like what is this fucking chaos yeah i i can't believe how many
16599.04, viewers there are on that that's you know what the people on zirko are confusing but the people
16604.24, who watch it are far more confusing that isn't anomaly true and as soon as you apply that same
16609.760000000002, skepticism to the media where you realize it's not the media's fault it's the degenerates that
16613.44, consume media oh my god the insight you gain into the entertainment no i'm just kidding okay
16618.559999999998, it's been fun uh stay safe be careful i'm sure we'll be screaming each other about something
16623.84, else soon enough check those next time next time next time we play league all right okay got you
16629.76, next time it's league okay only normal is right have fun be careful yeah fine all right that
