vPeG7O488v8,20200331,0,you
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,90,So
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,120,So
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,180,So
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,270,Bye.  Bye, bye, bye, bye, doodoritos.  Bye, doodoritos.  Hello, bye, doodoritos.  Bye, doodoritos.  Hello.  Can you define the word few for us?  We seem to have a different idea for that word, babe.  A few, I would say I was like...
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,293,Three, four, maybe five.  Maybe five.  How is this possibly getting overheated?  couple is two.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,326,What is six considered?  Six is several.  I think we're past like five.  including five is several.  Drink a drink. uko  Dippy  Dusty  StirP kale
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,360,Turp  Hurly  Dusty  Any past seven or several? No, because six is certainly not a few. Six can be several.  Go drip film it a cringe video about you. 52 seconds.  But like, I'm in a poly relationship. The reason why I'm in a poly-
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,386,Are you cool like Destiny? A CRP commentary?  Why the fuck is he making videos about me?  I know that if I'm not gonna if I'm not gonna get keep my girlfriend fuck you know, I'm gonna chase you around
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,400,I'm definitely not a cool fucking person right here. Are you as uncool as me or are you cool like destiny?  What is this video damn dude this guy must have like what is it DDR?  DRS, Destiny, no, DD, DDR, Destiny Derangement Syndrome, that's it right?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,424,I'm sure their poly relationship is a one way straight.  That feel when I'm begging Molina for crumbs of pussy and I get nothing on my own.  It's so cringe to get into these arguments too.  Because it's pretty clear that your idea of being a cool person is how many girls you
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,448,can get to fuck you.  But I don't want to get into that pissing contest because first of all, if we get into  an argument, especially if it's something like CRP, then by your own definition I'm probably  cooler than you.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,459,I feel like I'm back in a high school where I'm like, well how many people do you fuck?  That's how we fight it, how cool you are.  First of all, I don't have sex to be cool.  cringes fucking secondly I don't want to do like a dick waving contest about like who has sex with more girls that's so fucking weird
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,479,As long as argument on why means testing is bad and why universal programs are good  Why exactly is means testing bad just trying to understand?  Great question.  I can't wait for this one.  Means testing is horrible.  Universal programs are stronger universal programs.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,503,Okay, so they're stronger?  Whatever that means, what else?  Or quicker to implement?  Quick at implement?  That is true.  Universal can be quicker to implement if we ignore the political fight over getting  the funding needed to secure them or whatever.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,514,So because you don't have means testing that's one less like bureaucratic aspect.  So they can be quicker to implement.  That's true.  Universal programs are better overall.  It's better.  Are better overall.  So we got one real argument in there and that they're quicker to implement, which is
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,530,true.  But stronger and better overall are not real arguments.  They're politics.  It's better policy.  It's better message.  Better politics and better policy and better messaging.  So none of those are really arguments, but okay.  That's, those are the most significant reasons
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,549,why universal programs are better than means tested programs.  I feel like I'm reading a Twitter thread  from like a one follower Andy.  I don't think we had any, like,  I'm half-explanable, like they're gooder than...  The greatest example of this is social security
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,564,in the United States, perhaps.  Why would you say social security?  of all the possible  universe first of all social security is not universal it's only paid out to  old people  okay  secondly social security is in a way means tested because you only get out
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,581,what you pay in  not everybody gets social secure i don't know it's possible because as on his  rich family he's rich and everyone around his rich maybe he's never known  this before but for social security if you don't pay anything into his a worker
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,593,you don't get any money out i don't know if people don't realize that or not  social security is like a subsidized government social retirement plan  When you pay money in, that's what you get as a worker.  Like at the end.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,603,You don't get money and if you don't pay out.  And social security is an entire apparatus.  Social security is not easy to implement.  It's a pretty complicated system that involves  like an entire apparatus regarding your payroll taxes.  It's not an easy to implement thing.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,613,It is not easy to keep track of.  There's a lot of different parts of the government.  The Social Security Administration, the IRS,  is the one that does the revenue collecting.  Like that's like the worst possible example  that he could fucking think about in terms of,
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,624,like it's not universal.  It's very complicated to administer.  It is in a way means tested.  the more you put in, the more you get out.  Like,  absolutely the only examples in the United States.  And it's the only example that he has to go on.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,639,Yeah, now technically,  social security would be income tested,  not means tested, that's right.  But I'm sure he'd be opposed to both of those things, right?  States because every other policy is not means tested.  Like, snap benefits.  Think about Donald Trump cutting 750,
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,655,Ugh, thousand people's snap benefits.  Why is he able to do this?  Because it's not a universal program.  You can cut universal programs though.  What do you mean?  He can cut a program and say,  well, everybody that's getting this,
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,667,now you're just getting less.  Like, you can cut universal programs as well.  And actually, this is where we could make the argument,  a universal program might be in more danger of cuts.  Since a universal program is more expensive to maintain,
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,679,maybe you're more likely to cut from a universal program  because the savings would be so much higher.  because a cut across the board would save you so much money  as opposed to a means tested program  that might not require as much money.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,689,So that would actually be a weakness  of a universal program and that it might be  more lucrative to cut said program.  Although you could argue on the political well for it,  maybe not as many people would be favorite cutting it
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,698,because more people would be benefiting from it.  But if you really believe that it's the rich  and the corporations that run the country,  I don't know if rich people or upper middle class  people corporations really care about like,
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,708,there's measly benefits in the user program anyway,  so they wouldn't care about, I don't know.  So this is all of these arguments. It's just stupid.  Okay.  Are you okay with the fact of Social Security being capped?  Hold on.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,728,Give me something to spend my 55k points on. Thanks, dude. Keep me main and dreamin.  Are you okay with Social Security being capped meaning even if you pay millions over your lifetime you will only get three cam  or whatever it is when you take it, you can't pay millions into Social Security, Dan.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,740,It gets, you can only pay in so much and then you're done paying, I thought.  Uh oh.  Oh ho ho ho!  Alrighty.  Let's...  Okay, alright.  right  all right  wait, why are you saying no, Dan?  Wait, what?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,794,to  major
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,824,I'm not gonna be very relaxed.  Oh.  There is a max that you pay in though, right?  Like a cap that is certain.  I'm reading on it now.  I mean, I still pay Social Security  and I don't understand why.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,837,I might be getting scammed here.  Well, because you're young as fuck  and Social Security tapers off after it's like,  you only pay Social Security on the first,  I think it's $137,000 of income  and then pass that you don't pay anymore.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,848,But if you were to pay that max for like 20 or 30 years,  I thought it caps and then you don't pay  Social Security anymore, I thought.  Ah, thank you.  Fellow Zoomer for informing me of this fact.  We're millennials, not zoomers.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,862,What are you talking about?  Well, I guess that'd be Gen X, right?  84, so Gen X?  Oh, wait, you might be.  I think I'm one of the first millennials maybe.  Oh no, you're a solidly a millennial.  People born in 1981 are millennials?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,892,That seems like fake fucking news dude.  Wait, hold on.  So wait, you could be 40 years old and be a millennial?  No, it doesn't make sense. That's a goddamn. Why? I don't have the millennial. No  Oh Jesus.  Okay.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,945,Guys, this Tiger King shit on Netflix is all over the fucking place.  Is it actually good?  Yeah, is it actually good?  Or is it just stupid people saying it's good?  Like you can never tell.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,984,quarter of the  thick Dion  I'll tell her that you're a bad influence on me. I'll say that you try to push the vape on

vPeG7O488v8,20200331,1065,We're gonna co-op Halo, okay. Yeah  What have you been doing today? What do you stream today? Moot?  Played a little bit of blackout Dan then I played animal crossing  I was here. How are your animals crossing are they crossing low?

vPeG7O488v8,20200331,1106,Too late.  You can't, you couldn't catch all the fish today.  You don't even have a switch.  I go, I go to the rescue and take it from Nathan.  My switch now, motherfucker.  Can you give me?  How many fucking emails do I need to get from random companies about coronavirus?

vPeG7O488v8,20200331,1148,Well, you probably have well, it's probably like a pressure thing. They're probably like fuck everybody else is selling out  Like if we don't do we look like assholes? I bet people fucking click it too  I bet they get mad fucking clicks compared to like normal marketing
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,1158,Why when you get it because I think people are curious. They're like, okay, here's another one.

vPeG7O488v8,20200331,1190,You read there's an article today that came out said that coronavirus is like airborne  Which apparently is like a bigger deal not like they already knew I don't think that's true  Airborne like it's just floating in the air and not just aerosolized or whatever
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,1204,Yeah, let me see if I can find the article again. I was reading it this morning because like we already we know that it can work  As an aerosol. So like for instance like if somebody sneezes it'll hang in the air for maybe a few hours
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,1214,It can or something but it does like floating around in the air. I don't let me find the other  Well, I think it was on  It's the droplet means destiny  Dan is a droplet mean like drop him on his head mean. Ha ha sorry

vPeG7O488v8,20200331,1295,You're a big ass target, bud.  Yeah, but it's way more fun to fight kids in vehicles and run around the map in a vehicle  and find children to fight than it is to run around and get shot in your ass.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,1307,some sniping  I don't think that's a clip of the  year  and such a good clip that's a perfect clip  why does this game I haven't played that much yet but like why does it seem like  This game is so much more prone to fucking camping and sniping than the last one was
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,1339,I'm actually sure I think there's a lot of I think it's just higher elevation  So people maybe want to do it more. Maybe the snipers are less rare wrong.

vPeG7O488v8,20200331,2429,Sneaky fucking bullet  What do you think's worse being banned or being ignored by the streamer?  But I put push it ignored by the streamer all the time. They don't really mind  Oh, not that bad.  I don't even get up here, you fucking idiot.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,2466,the  what dance  what's your problem and  and you can't get it  only out here is the other words  that are right  we're gonna bring it up  also uh...  sad news even saturday's and i can't think  uh... you jwagan
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,2493,You lost money on the stock market?  No, not that Mr. Mitten.  The G wagon.  It's.  It's not.  Everyone the G wagon made that fucking noise.  We were driving.  Yeah, it's doing that all the time.  And it's not working.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,2505,Yeah.  He is the baby.  Like other people's.  There's a reason why he is not driving.  All of a sudden like, oh, the gas doesn't work anymore.  Well, like you personally gas the engine revs, but it's like it's in drive.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,2517,It's not doing shit.  So I had to pull it over and restart it.  Like it's not your game.  Restart it and fucking worked.  Yeah, but that's shit happening all the time and I'm very scared because I don't think that I don't know man
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,2529,It's time to put it out the pastor traded in for some pieces  Get rid of the G-Wagon  No, exactly I've ascended to fucking two-wheeled ownership, which is really the most premium form of  Yeah, tell your wife you want uh the tassel truck
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,2543,The cyber truck hell that shit is like really long  on , say for your debt , which would cost to swap that whole thing out , no, probably like  is it more money usually like swap a transmission of all but it's a G wag and so it's probably like what is a like a
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,2565,some shit right? I think that's probably only worth 40. It's a 2008 with a lot of miles.  Oh, I don't know. I would imagine it's probably like 15 grand to do it. It's just not worth it.  Oh. Oh, shit. Wait, you can do yours first then then I'll do mine. Oh, no. Mine's the whole
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,2587,discussion what we're gonna say. So I did some research today on the SBA loans  that Trump and everyone's been talking about and unless the person at the SBA  is completely full of shit this is what's really interesting. So there's two
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,2603,things that are like insane.  Sorry. So the two things that's really interesting they have the paycheck  protection program, which basically means if you continue to employ your employees that  you have, if you do nothing else, they'll give you 250% of their wages for whatever period
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,2630,this is going on.  So if you were going to pay 20 grand a month in wages for six months, they'll give you  that times two for the whole duration.  And they might completely credit it all back to you.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,2641,That's the first thing.  That's fucking crazy.  It is alone, but they say that it's completely grantable back to you.  Now, here's the second thing that's fucking incredibly stupid.  I don't understand why this is.  If you apply, they give you 10,000 right away just for applying, and that's supposed to be
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,2656,to like, hey, your applications in process, don't worry about it.  And if your application gets denied, you get to keep the 10-grant.  I shit you not.  I don't know how that could possibly be in the thing, but they're like, yeah, that's
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,2668,the case.  it applies. We give them 10 grand right away. And, you know, if you'd get denied, you can keep the 10 grand.  We have nice.  Well, I mean, it's free 10 grand for anyone with LLC out there fucking go do it, kids.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,2683,Why did my doop just sleep to death? I don't know they could do that.  You're a fucking FBI. So okay. Okay. Listen, listen to this. Listen, you said that you would get diamond by March 13th, 2020, right?  Today is February 24th, 2020.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,2701,Yeah, I'll be diving by March 13th, 2020.  I will be higher LP than you.  And if you, and if you, and if you, and if you are not,  then what happens?  I will give you $50 into your PayPal.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,2712,Okay. All right. Thanks.  Right. This is March 13th.  This is so long.  What is this? Why is it?  Why is it?  So he probably didn't have like $50.  So he kept like upping the bet, like doubling it.  And now he's up to like $135 and like asking for payment plans.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,2726,It's like, D  is so fucking great. Who asked for a payment plan on shit like that? God, I love that kid. What a fucking legend.  Hey, Steven, Steven. Hey, Steven. I have a question, Steven. Would you share Molina's nudes on Twitter if you found out that she played Lee Sin with another guy? Just curious, Steven. Bonus meme.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,2752,I can't pay.  I can't pay.  I can't pay you. I haven't got it. What is this from? I don't know. I was just stopped.  Unignor my boy bullet train to feel I dared him to send Suleiman the magnificent.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,2794,Or is it Oh I watched a movie last night. Have you guys ever seen Donnie Darko?  Oh my Georgia chemistry digest right now.  My  life is not like the old movies read on the stock movie I think that's number one on every list ever.

vPeG7O488v8,20200331,2839,If you want another fucking amazing video Steve or movie I put in chat  It's a foreign language, but it's so fucking good. I don't watch this  Why? Because he hates non-English people.  Isn't that right, Mooten?  I'm not gonna say I hate them or I don't hate them.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,2858,I don't think it deserves a response.  Do you love non-English people?  Guys, can you get the Uncut Gems trailer song yet?  Why is that guy not released at remix?  remix such a fucking pog sign.  I do watch Dubbed anime and I'm proud.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,2880,Real know you do.  I'm good to know.  But I'll watch subs too if it's people tell me I only watch them so I'm usually like a  simply.  I'm gonna throw out a hot take.  I actually don't think most Dubbed anime is very bad.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,2900,I feel like oh  Here it comes boys. I feel like it's a meme like there are some that I've watched like where the dubs are obviously like  But like for the most part if I watch a dub Danime
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,2912,Not that fucking bad as long as they don't like completely change like the I  I guess wording and stuff and like fuck up the messaging. I don't think it's that bad. Mm-hmm. It's gotten better weeps really give it a chance
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,2931,God bless you  I like the Dragon Ball Z pie stuff yeah, I mean I can understand what people like Dragon Ball Z dubbed  Moot you have Atlantic broadband, right? Oh, yeah  Email that they sent today that they're gonna be having a network maintenance for three days next week

It was I mean like no internet for three days  I was no internet  Let me look for all of my I'm just fucking with you  I can't you have a better reaction than not for me. It would be all of the fucking beach, mr
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,2968,Uh, no, I don't have the email, Dan.  Because I'm fucking with you.  Never.  Your mic is from fucking Obama.  I mean, probably can't find Japan on a map.  This opinion doesn't carry much.  Oh, fuck.  Maybe it's happening now, Dan.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,2985,Maybe that's why you're so robotic right now.  Oh, Dan.  Robo, Dan, kid, loving.  You'll hear from my attorney, Lucas.  I'm going to take everything into your fucking war.  Oh, yeah.  Do you not love kids?  Wow, Dan's already got an attorney on Retainer for the fucking pedophile shit. Holy fuck. Oh my god
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,3004,All right, my turny said that I can't prove one way or the other that Dan is or is not a pedophile, okay?  These are hurtful things that you're saying I  Personally don't believe he is, but I don't have any evidence to check
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,3019,Where did you find this guy the back of a fucking phone book the big adult defender for the small people lever?  Dan's lawyer right there  Oh my god.  When we all get old, like, let's say we're all in our six-season, we're still gaming and shit-togging.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,3037,Are we all able to make fun of each other for being old?  Are we gonna get banned from two?  Oh, fuck no.  By then you'll probably get banned from two for swearing.  It'll be like no cuss words.  It'll be like TV or whatever.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,3048,Or you only have X number per stream.  Robo Dan never went to Japan.  Fuck, why do I have the joint sounds on now? Oh?  There is Darius the man of the eye day. What exactly are the conditions of your bet?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,3062,You know that what was called as diamond three right?  Yeah, but he's listen. He's a support player. He goes down and up it happens, you know, and then what is just  How long do you have to do this?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,3075,He's just sitting there. How long I have  Today's 31st rate, so I think I'd be the fourth, so four days  Including the time now so four days and like seven hours. You think it's realistic you're gonna be able to make this happen Darius
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,3094,You know you can just say no a guy traveled the world in some amount of days  people with an airplane or
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,3133,all this stuff I'm gonna run out of money I think we need to you better  start going seriously than Darius Dan I take it so seriously speaking which I  haven't received my payment from you have you received your twitch paycheck
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,3145,yet not yet they said the so it's like some weird system when you're affiliate  it's like the after a month yeah but it's like 15 days after the month or  something I have you hey Darius I've been in the game
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,3160,I don't know if they changed it for fillets, but I know it used to be like you had to wait two months to get your payment. I don't know  something weird. Yeah, just remember our deal Darius. Okay. Oh, I remember
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,3174,You were a fucking nobody. I brought you into relevance. I pushed you hard at my own expense. There is still let me down  I remember those messages when the alley stream happened and you're like hey Darius, you know, oh my god
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,3187,Just wipe it. Just wipe it. Just get it out of here. Just get it out of the memory  What you do like the men in black stuff? I remember harkton. I  Remember  Are you joining? Thank you. What are you?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,3200,Okay.  Okay.  Okay, you need to have an unbreakable mental. Okay. Your prior mental has been broken before.  No, I think yesterday we won all of our games. I was going to.  No, we didn't. We lost two. Okay. Oh, we lost. That's true. We shouldn't be losing any games.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,3224,You're in platinum now, right? Yes.  I  Watching his part League is like fucking watching empires of Acadium always rooting for the other side. Yeah, it's true  But all over for you today, Stephen. Yeah  If you get diamond will you stop playing me
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,3244,I  That's more than usual so last time you were diamonds  That's a damn lie. Hey, it was like  I bet my  Let's not do that wait, didn't we get the diamond last season? I'm almost positive. I'm positive  You know you're a season nine on your ha plot 156 LP, but I think you stopped playing
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,3276,Thank you to K down there, but I don't remember  I don't know if option she shows you your highest rank or what you ended up. I'm not sure  What's the highest rank you've ever had last time you were diamond with season there used to be diamond one a long time
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,3290,And I can season three when the game didn't suck so much fucking ass for a degree  Like real talk if you dedicated your life. I don't know Dan. No one knows. Okay. These are unknowable things  He would have to swap roles have to play a better a roller get like if there was a billion dollars at the end of it
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,3308,Do you think  Like grandmaster whatever it is a billion dollars at the end of it. I'd start learning mid or jungle  That's what I would do. I think you just gotta learn jungle  I  Ls said that I carry is the most important
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,3324,Yeah, there's differences between like pro play and like shit or play though. Well you talk about and low you low  Would be considered low for sure does leave do that shit when you start a new season  You're not like all the way at the bottom. You're like starting halfway in or something depends
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,3342,It depends on how many games you win at the so's yeah  So like if you're challenger this season next season are you gonna I think the max you can be is like  Diamond or plot one. Yeah, I think it's plot one. Yeah, but like everyone else gets cut like super hard
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,3357,It's almost unfair to make these challenger players not have to play against fucking idiots in the lower ranks and like  They if you give any challenger player a low-ranked League account  He can get back to challenger or at least Grandmaster like in a few days like really yes
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,3370,Yeah, we're at our all just like decayed or weeks  probably days if you win like 30 games in a row you'd probably be like master  getting like a hundred like 50 like 60 one player carry that hard and lead when
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,3386,you're when the skill differential is that great you can you of course you stick  a challenge usually it's for like top and or it's like mid-jungular top laners  you can do that well no any role even even even a support player that's a
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,3401,challenger player can probably hard carry up to like masters or something solo hard carry up the master's support  Yeah, probably yeah, if you're if the skill difference is that great  You'd probably play you'd probably be playing like carry supports, but I think you can do it
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,3418,Is the cooping guy that guy actually coming is that like a real voice clip  I'll try playing a few times on stream and see if you could ban for it  I used to boost people on support roll as diamond dude.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,3433,Anytime I played with Wolf Squad, I'd just, I'd just fucking ant.  Dude, I watched him jungle for you and he was like, yeah.  I swear man, I can carry him, I can do this dude.  It did not work out very well.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,3446,I'm having some rough jungle games.  Why did the Q-cams all?  So we're ever going to fix or talk about the new account system  system getting 30 plus every match will be three whole two is down below my MMR
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,3461,Mr. Mr. Putin  Darius, Darius, Darius  If I get the AC girl to come on stream and admit I did not put the AC down at all  Will you believe me that I never turned the AC?  I never said you did. I just thought it was stupid as fuckford
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,3477,Yeah, stupid. I want to disagree  I want to do this so bad.  Oh, you won't be able to.  No, man.  I think you could.  That's did you have any last run?  Um, probably like 20 or 30 hour many lives you get throughout the whole run.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,3497,But I think I mean, I can kill every monster without dying.  It's just a matter of like being consistent.  the  mister what's high nighters  rank  uh... high nighters your friend  but i don't know shit about fucking me  i don't know shit about high nighter
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,3522,didn't mean we played a  flex with destiny anything you'd like to be  he said he said it was challenging around if you're trolling  and i was  one  All I know is after I talk to him sometimes,  he's really fucking bitchy and angry.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,3538,And like, what's going on?  Look at his thing and he's lost like five games in a row.  Yeah, that'll do it.  I have to cash out on my fucking America's card table  or whatever it is.  Oh yeah.  How much you have on it?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,3557,I think 560.  Oh, I got into that shit too.  The paid money for that, just for being a streamer.  feels good what the America's card room dude got sponsored by him what he's  fucking with you I'm not  oh why do we not ban Wukong why then ban him if he's we've you have that much
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,3586,trouble with him ban him I don't have any trouble with him because I'm a god  player but then don't worry about it.  Yes, that do it and you're like why the fuck did I van Wukong? I fucking hate the champion.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,3597,That didn't happen.  Didn't this guy have Thresh queued last time? Why do we go from Thresh to fucking Morgana? Fuck me.  God damn it. Thresh is a fucking A.S. tier. Support. Numero Uno.  Fuck. I missed that Hades game. That was fucking sick. Do I erase it again?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,3625,Wait, I actually wait. Hold on. I'm actually so curious. Why did you like Hades, but you fucking  I hated, um...  That noise...  What was the other one we played?  What was the other game? Sort of the C, right?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,3638,Oh god, I don't remember. Everybody asked me to play.  Oh, Morta, that one.  I don't know. I just like, I hadn't played roguelikes, I guess, as much.  I can't put into words, but I don't like it. I don't really remember more to too much.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,3650,I don't think I gave it a fair shot.  Maybe it was just like the atmosphere. Maybe it was like the way it looked.  I don't know.  but he's fucking litty  Hades was litty, more to was shitty and got it
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,3663,okay  what the fuck was that?  yo mama bitch  JUST

vPeG7O488v8,20200331,7138,Fuck you by claiming you if you're working like part-time or full-time just because they want to steal your deduction  Sometimes it makes sense financially, but you should make them pay you back that tax credit if they do or that tax deduction if they do
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,7150,Just pop it  What?  The worst  Yeah, we got four here. We'll come and stop. Okay, we'll come stop. Yeah  And where they have done the damage on the grave is already  St fallenrymbar
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,7182,I'm beautiful.  Go to bed, go to bed.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,7213,Yeah, technically, wait, what the fuck? ilda among the  seven  in for you to go back

vPeG7O488v8,20200331,7319,um oh smite in 20 seconds, so
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,7349,that  was he doing  his
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,7383,Just getting on there. Why is Vigar a bot? I don't know. I...  This is probably the best CC in the game I think. Vigar has the single best CC spell  in the game and he's not fighting with us. He's trying to solo push bot.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,7410,Just so much damage to I didn't care about his damage just having that huge ass fucking cage around me is so good  It cucks Leona it cucks Warwick it cucks stylus your opinion on something. I noticed don't know
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,7423,How much you interact with XQ see but I feel like he's actually pretty smart bit just either  Axe dumb or doesn't know how to phrase  We were kidding.  Oh, Juggy, you're a small plane.  Yeah, XQ seems like a pretty bright guy, regardless
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,7448,of whether he knows a lot.  He seems like he's pretty smart.  I didn't make very much last year, just a little bit  from some freelance audio engineering,  but it was negligible.  Oh, then it's probably better that your parents' country.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,7462,I don't know if you get-  Man, you should get something on your check on your rebate based on dependents, right?  Did they- did they approve that or no?  You'd think they would.  Fucking this piece of shit game, dude!
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,7480,I just- I was gonna press R as soon as I fucking move.  Just-  So much fucking CC.  Yeah.  Don't die.  He is dead. I'm gonna honda- oh anyways, this applies too. Nice.  There's nothing they can get on the map, so maybe let's go.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,7506,If we lose this game, it's probably one of the saddest games we've ever lost.  All we just need to do is push this 5, it's pretty easy.  He's still splitting.  I don't understand  we could lose the game here
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,7542,Oh, and he backs right before getting the in-hip turret when the fight is already over.  He's like playing optimally fucking shit.  It's so good.  I'm gonna strike him 30. I'm up in 20. If you can keep Warwick there, we need to get
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,7574,the Dragon 100%. Can Vigar cage him?  We're all gonna die here. This might be Gigi.  Don't even try it. We'll legit lose.  Can we get a word on it?  target don't even try it will will will legit lose
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,7605,can we get a word on it?  if you both die here we lose the game  ok that's good right?  I mean, this cloud is still doesn't really mean much.  As long as they don't push, I guess it's fine.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,7638,Instead of trying to 5v5 for no reason?  reason  why is it so fucking hard just follow him  We need to walk to Baron and ward it, okay?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,7672,I don't know why I'm CSing.  We can play around this if we want.  If we want to do like a meme here, we can set up a trap.  Why did you do it that way?  You ping so much.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,7691,Yeah, because you don't fucking listen to anything.  You really need that grump right now, huh?  When Baroness is coming up, you really gotta be doing that grump.  We have two Snagets on it.  Yeah, now we look, could be halfway dead,
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,7706,and you're fucking over there doing grump.  No way.  Kill that Warwick?  Oh my god, we all just got feared and I'm altered and I'm  We're too close to the works you guys should just run  with
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,7745,this  sigh  Okay, now we go back to Baron.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,7777,Silas is dead for a long time.  Should be running straight here.  No grump, no fucking red buff, no wolves.  Just run straight to fucking Baron.  That was an uncool man.  What?  Leo is half fucking dead.  Okay, get away from him this time, which we did.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,7806,Nice, easy fucking kill.  Good cage.  We got the Baron.  Killing the Leona.  Leona nice and then we end the fucking game  That was way too hard  opposed II
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,7840,Oh  Jesus fucking crisis vigor is fucking trash dude  I can't believe how hard it is to win some of these fucking games like I'm just gonna walk the best CC and all of fucking League of  Legends and go split push like a fucking brain dead moron. It's so fucking stupid. How hard this game was
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,7874,This game should have been over ten minutes ago  So dumb go go go next go go  Are you back in provost? I don't know don't worry about my premise. We're getting you to diamond right?  Let's go. I have a lot of games. It's fine. Just keep going win a lot in a row
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,7897,Okay  Did you get your 10k meat bucks from the SBA? No, but I'm almost positive  There's got to be some strings attached to that application like you probably have to have like a minimum number of employees or some shit
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,7908,Some I've actually had two different investors contact me like about like oh like if you had like a big investment from like me and some  Angel Dussevers could you blah blah blah do anything or whatever  Why have a spider?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,7921,What is that bug way that just jumped  I don't know what I would do as a streamer.  Could anybody think of it?  If you had a lot of money as a streamer,  how would you use that money to make more money?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,7930,Can you do anything like that?  Bro, you know how your website is really cool?  You could create a company that offered your website.  Stop.  Aren't you really close to being done with that?  I need to Google the second cast, I'll say hold on.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,7964,Please don't give me that God-versick and top laner again too. Holy shit.  The Silas are the Wuko.  The Fiora and then whatever.  the Fjordcii  Thank God. They didn't very good. So what are the guys who reached out to you say exactly like it was just they said
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,7984,I had a meeting two days ago in the morning  They were they basically they said that they were hooked up to a ton of capital of us  And they were asking me like oh like if we were invested a million dollars in your brand like could you do anything with that to like make money?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,7994,Or what kind of returns you're looking for but I have no idea like I don't think that the thing is is that like being a streamer?  Like it's kind of unique in that you can't just like throw money at something and make money like if you
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,8003,You have a YouTube channel you've got merchandise but you can pay all of these out via like rev splits or something  I don't know it's time to start a hedge fund. Yeah a Bitcoin hedge fund  It's already been done. I already did it. Yeah
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,8016,Wait, did any of you guys did either you have coins on Mount Gosh  There pay did you tell you the rates are paying those coins back at?  What?  You said like 7,500 bucks in Bitcoin or something?  Yeah, it's fucking sick as fuck.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,8030,What do you hire the market rate for Bitcoin?  Well, they had to do it at the time of commencement  for their proceedings.  Well, hold on.  I might be reading this wrong.  hold on one second  cargo
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,8062,the  and  the  uh  on  and  on its
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,8092,onto a level of consultation is the  I just miss like the parties  Well, it feels good to be invited to big fancy business cat meetings and you know, they're  all on the amort with you and why invested in shit.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,8107,It feels good.  Were these like VC investment companies or were they just too random?  It was a collection of guys that represent Angel and Busters or something.  But there's always, there's a ton of money behind the scenes right now in this industry
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,8121,for people looking to throw money at something to make money.  It's pretty insane.  Yeah, there's a ton of metric capital investment.  Yeah.  He supports it especially.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,8152,Okay.  Are you here?  Ready?  Are you invading?  Um, I'm not paying attention right now. Don't do it. We're gonna do the same event. We always okay 128
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,8185,what about  j Presents  if  have  I

vPeG7O488v8,20200331,8229,I'm pretty sure they've lost like 90% of the fucking creditors just because of the fucking how confusing the whole process has been  Half of it is in Japanese  Well a lot of it's in Japanese and just like there's different sights and shit you log into and only
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,8244,Fucking dumpster dude  Easy.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,8276,Alright ready for level 2?  We're not level 2 but if you want to, yeah  How much longer to level 2?  It's not a long time, so  Let's go  You got Kogma please?  Yeah yeah  Nice charm  I'm gonna go back to the next one.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,8300,I'm gonna go back to the next one.  I'm gonna go back to the next one.  If I hire people, Dan...  Oh, I guess I could just W2 them.  I think that if I switch over my YouTube stuff,  or when I start working with people,
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,8322,I think I wanna make people like exclusively mine.  Like I don't want them to like work for anybody else.  Can I, my lad, to do that?  I guess if I W2 them, I could.  I'm California.  I mean, you keep them from,
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,8335,I guess you could have them sign non-compete those  and not evaluating them.  But I would have, they would have to be like a W2  to be a non-compete, right?  Not sure what they can do is you can insert a penalty clause,
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,8347,which says if anyone else hires you,  they have to pay me X amount of...  Well, that's only 50 employees in California.  Doesn't, you don't know if Steve  will stay in California either, so fuck hell.  Come to Florida, we got no worker rights down here.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,8362,take their kid if they fuck with you  Cake said he doesn't have any problems signing that so you got one down  Cakes work is such that like he doesn't need his full-time attention. That's fine. Like you can carry the guy
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,8388,Well no it's not that he does nothing it's just that like the responsibilities that he  has are like such that like I would expect him to be able to cover that while like  You could have just said he doesn't.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,8402,I mean, that's fine.  Clearly the therapist.  He's really young now.  What about you, Daniel?  You got all your S.B.A.s arms there?  Nah, we're going for an ounce.  Like, fucking 500 forms.  Oh, I was saying there's no way there's got to be like some strings attached to that right like
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,8431,You have to have like a minimum number of employees or something. I'm sure  I didn't hear anything about minimum employees. What's this way? I  Heard literally apply get 10. Ted that's I'd never pay it back  Like buddy of mine. He just essentially a Dan landlord

vPeG7O488v8,20200331,9046,He has nothing but armor.  What the fuck?  I'm going to be a little bit more.  I'm going to be a little bit more.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,9081,Oh, it's almost.  I don't know how Lee knew he was there.  I think that pushed.  That was such a random cue.  What is going on here?  Cass is a mid.  You guys can just get that terror.  us we're scared of leaf. Yeah, nobody's
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,9106,can we get air drag soon? Are you gonna be  ready for that? Oh yeah I want to get rid of first though. That one guy is stream-sticking.  Which one guy? Ahh look at Chad again. Ah fuck I don't know someone said something
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,9137,in all Chad about you being Destiny. I think it was Zillyn. Did they? Mmhmm. It was like  right as we started so that are you the real destiny?  Oh.  It was casted in.  How do people remember that?  There are people actually watching the leaf trees.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,9173,Imagine exposing yourself like that.  Cringe  Why doesn't that say ever touch on bandwagon topics?  I feel like you'd boost his wish or because it's boring to me  I don't like to jump on to circle jerk so like I don't want to talk about coronavirus for fucking 4,000 days straight or like
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,9189,I don't know. I'm just exploring feels like people just do a career show. I don't know it's not interesting  I don't usually like I don't maximize for my viewer count
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,9222,Oh, we have five. Oh, no, no one.  Yeah, go.  Oh, okay.  Nice.  Oh, good.  What?  What are you doing?  I got targeted for some reason. I have no idea why.  It's probably could be the damage to an enemy unit while under turn. I didn't shit.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,9262,Oh my god, how much stuff did I kill myself?  Oh my god, that's actually really good.  That hit me? Holy shit, the range on his E.  Okay, this is 45.  Just got Aced.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,9292,That was a really bad fight.  I didn't even get the ult, came my ult off.  On the ward.  One more drake for win.  Sol, nana.  We win.  I didn't do so.  lets go
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,9332,holy shit  mmm  this horn is fucking crowding  and its just gotta little armor  He's got a lot of fucking upgraded items. He's got a lot of help. Yeah, this dude's just taking himself out  Can I kind of productive because I ultimately lose it all
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,9359,Okay, so flash  Oh, nobody's here.  What are you doing?  Fuck off.  I don't want to fight this.  Please go farm set you dog.  Oh my god, I just realized what every conservative I talk to is going to say once the coronas
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,9384,should have run its chorus.  If like 100 or 200,000 people die, rather than them initially saying that we did all  the good steps and everything was great. They're gonna backtrack it and they're gonna say they're  gonna move the global system and say well actually a hundred or 200,000 people dying that's not that
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,9396,bad we actually did do really good. I just realized that that's gonna be the talking point clip this.  If I talk to that turning point USA guy or or electric fan again that's gonna be their new thing  is that a hundred or 200,000 people dying isn't gonna be that that's not even that bad.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,9409,And the really conservative ones are gonna say that was more like 16,000.  Wait what do you mean what?  like we're gonna deny the numbers without an alt-right job Holocaust yeah  gotcha good one it wasn't actually 200,000 people that died it was like 50,000 and
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,9429,we moved 150,000 of them to Israel yeah is the revisionist  Are you okay?  I'm dead!  Can you finish it?  Nope.  No, my spooking me through so hard!  I probably lost the game off of that, or we are losing the game now off of that.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,9454,Why are you so low HP? How are you dying to Baron? We're like 22 minutes in. Is it?  I was taking it. I was all taking it. I should have swished that girl, I guess. Or me, probably should have just walked to the fucking thing. I don't...
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,9476,Okay, that thing like super killed you. I don't know. I don't know if that was...  Yeah, like  Okay, please I just want to get here I don't want to lose this game. Yeah, me neither dragon for us up go please
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,9493,We can kill him. I have all  Lee is doing dragon for right now. Are you running to it? Are you?  There's a thing right here. I'm just gonna. He still loves my  I'm almost dead.  You fucking bitch.  Fizzly is so mad from his early game.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,9518,He's getting carried so fucking hard by this horn.  the  thizzly is so mad from his early game is getting carried so fucking hard by this one  we have to  we have to get like next parent and that cast and it is just going to end the whole game for us if you can
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,9540,Fuck me.  Why is he even allowed- oh, could he clear the banner still?  Need a
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,9591,I don't think that's good.  I'm gonna get my ass whipped.  You guys got a freckle?  I guess that's good.  Should we try to grab an in-hit mid or what do you think?  You guys, you guys see a pushman. There's nobody with you.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,9620,I can't push alone, because Cassinum is at the point where he'll kill me.  Yeah.  Where are you?  what
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,9683,Yes, both are here.  I'm over here.  Are you running away from me?  Please?  Okay, just, yeah, don't.  Okay, just take a minute.  Okay, this is bad.  We need to leave.  I feel like we need someone who can just split.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,9707,I don't think we're going to win a team fight with this orange.  cast almost being 16.  What are we doing right now? What's the plan?  Cast it in his top.  Cast in his top, we should, I guess we can try to force.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,9736,They can't be a guest, you just have to do it.  If we wait, we're not gonna be able to.  Like if we can catch this guy, it would actually be so good.  Please, somebody kill him.  Okay.  Cass is gonna come in and clean up.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,9758,You need to be ready.  Cassadin is gonna clean up.  Poppy stay together!  I love you.  Okay, Eko, you gonna come?  Ping, ping for him! You have to be a leader!  Ping, tell him to come back!  Okay.  Okay.  This is what happens, I guess.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,9787,Yeah, you have to stay together.  If you don't stay together, this is what's gonna happen.  Yeah, I mean, we knew that before this happened.  like 15 seconds of drag I should just left once I go walks for zero what turns up that
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,9808,shit is gone we might lose both this is not good not with the fucking one in  eight set. Let's go treat the bearish.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,9844,This is a really big item for me let me get this please. None I'll get last  Swiss bear or whatever the other  enemies are the thing that hurt Cucks HP  that
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,9876,10  X  We're going to get real.  Yeah this can is probably over.  So fucking gone.  I'm out.  I left.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,9906,Just forfeit.  I'm not coming back.  this right there  you know they said fucking yeah we're being gonna come and sing top liners today  that was like in like he was so useless the entire fucking game  I  Just wish you would have built lights like HP that's what would have been so much more useful
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,9941,And the bear obviously fucked it, but like fuck me, okay, you wanna do your thing real quick  I'm gonna be back like 10 minutes. Yeah, I'll be back like 10 minutes. I'll be required this idiot  What  One and seven Draven. That's because every time we got ganked, I wasn't getting any of the kills, but we crushed our lane.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,9963,I think I had almost a hundred CS lead on the Kogma like I died a lot  But like I had ten assists but like a lot of those assists were like off of games  Also Kogma was smurf it doesn't matter Kogma was smurfing
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,9991,Coggin got shit on that game.  Orin is what won them that game.  Orin and then into Kassadin.  Even at the end of this game, I was still 60 CS up this dude.  This guy, Coggin was not the reason they won that game.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10018,Even if he is smurfing he got fucking shit on in line  you need a permabant or dodge orin do you I don't know I mean our guy went one and  eight like I don't know  the
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10054,time was the  diamond  film  of  the  one
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10090,I  There it is there it is there is there is turn required this idiot oh  What  Headshot  Oh my god
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10132,There it is there it is there he is there he is turn required this idiot  What  Vivian Wolf and Lady Rain Cloud were saying they were cringing your trans takes, talking  to Ariel, Scorsela on her illness channel.  Vivian, I'd be interested to hear some of her feedback on some things.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10151,Some of those trans questions are really hard.  Lady Rain is a fucking idiot and she damages the trans community by trying to speak out  for them.  I don't take anything she says seriously whatsoever.  I would talk to any other person in the world before her on anything related to trans topics.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10163,But the Vivian person seems pretty intelligent.  I would be interested in her feedback.  You will always struggle with Orin unless you just outright lose his lane when you're
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10193,playing Draven personally.  Well, the problem wasn't just Orin, the problem was they also had a cast event.  If it would have been like any other random mid laner,  we could have maybe dealt with the orang or whatever.  But like, it was orang and casted in,
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10203,and then late game, Kogma's gonna pop off too.  Like they just, they had a really good team comp  that if we didn't win like immediately,  they were gonna be popping off.  Like that's a, like fuck, that's a lot.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10213,It's a lot to deal with.  I was pointing to having a good top lane in game.  I think a good top laner can be like,  pretty influential mid and late game.  I think that mid and definitely jungle  for the first like 15 minutes
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10226,so much more influential.  I think a jungle like sets the pace of the game  for every single lane, and then maybe mid  if mid is a big Romer, like a Talon,  or anybody that can run around lanes and kill people.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10239,How big is your hard drive?  What do you think is an acceptable hard drive size?  I don't know, at least 500 gigs.  Bare minimum, right?  Or like an SSD or some shit.  Wait, where is this book smarts guy?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10252,Go on, go on.  Good boy. Ready? Go. Oh. Oh. Good boy, Milo. My. You speak to her. Go. Oh. Good boy.  Ready? Go. Oh. Oh. Oh. Good boy, Milo. Oh my God. This cat is so adorable. Holy  Look at this big fucking destiny watch this clip. Yeah
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10286,L S.  Oww.  What do you think, Mia?  Those feet go...  Oww.  Mia?  Oww.  So, Oww.  Oww.  Oww.  I think you might want to know this.  It'll just pay you react amazing.  oh
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10324,hall iti  god  Fuck damn it if I had the Chronos pendant, I would have gotten it
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10369,the  smite of nobility lock on  i'm sure there are some smells like that that champion or hero or whatever the  fuck it's called the probably doesn't have any  my guess  if you find a lot of clips and gaming one more entertaining than just chatting
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10391,also but yeah that's because that's what i i don't know that's what i like like  doctor disobecken shit i always like this is so much more than just like  Random streamer drama or random Korean girl says something in broken English and everybody thinks it's hilarious. I'm gonna
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10413,Steven wait is Darius back  Or did I just queue alone I can't tell because he's fucking muted. I'm not except  Hello?  Hello?  Hi.  Yeah, I just got back.  Are you ready?  Yeah, we're going to try one game where I'm not on voice.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10438,Okay, good luck.  Okay, that's no, that's fine.  Okay, because I'm going to chat with the guy.  So good luck.  Okay.  the  that you had?  Yeah, we could.  That one sounds like I need a longer time to go over it,
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10468,and I'm doing this in between games.  If you want, I'm curious to take your tech  on the private public language thing,  if you want to do that.  Yeah, so I guess the more and more I've thought about it,
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10478,it seems like the question is how do you  have band-aid solutions to your system  for friends or personal requests or life lessons you learn?  Does it have to be logical to change your system?  When, okay, so I'm sure you know this.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10500,So I try to avoid the word logical or rational  in the discussion unless I have a concise meaning  of what it means.  When you say logical, do you mean like it follows  some like deductive thought process  where a conclusion like logically
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10511,or like reasonably comes from some number of premises?  Or what do you mean by that just so I understand?  Yeah, I guess if you can't connect it  to your current system of arguments.  And I don't know how else to put it,
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10522,but the conclusions where you feel like I've arrived there  from thinking about it diligently,  and I don't just have a feeling about it.  Yeah, I would like to imagine that most,  most are why, but I'd like to imagine
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10532,every position I have is like that, yeah.  So I should be able to connect it somehow argumentatively.  Okay.  So I guess that's the tough part  because sometimes there's things that people tell me  where I just, I take their word for it
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10548,until I can like figure it out.  But I mean, it's a different situation for you  because you've gone through this discussion so much.  Yeah.  Because for most people, I feel like they have a filter  where the word with the hard R
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10563,just kind of feels cringey coming off their lips  and they'll generally avoid it even in private.  And so I think the idea that somebody not only does it,  but like regularly defends it  or isn't bothered by it, seems strange.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10577,Yeah, I guess it can be,  but that's not really an argument for anything, right?  Yeah, for sure.  I'm just giving perspective on what people  are feeling about this,  because then I think people try to jump in  and they've taken different approaches
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10590,to convincing you of this,  but unfortunately, none of them were very good like that.  Yeah, I mean, I guess if you want,  we could try, I hate that I'm almost  making an eye-dubs tier argument here.  I mean, is your goal gonna be to try
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10602,to say that like all forms of racial or edgy humor are okay,  except specifically racial or edgy humor involving the N word or?  Yeah.  So the problem I have is that like for my system, I looked into it,
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10614,like I really tried to like sort out what I thought on this.  And it's just like a bandaid that's there.  Like I don't feel like I need to do a ton of work at like, like we,  we understand that the N word has a lot of like historical context behind it.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10628,It can hurt people no matter, you know, how it's heard.  It can even hurt people just to know that you regularly use a word that has that capability  to it, that you're perpetuating the further private use of it, even if publicly you make
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10641,an effort not to say it.  I guess how come you can't extend that public effort into private conversations?  If I catch myself, if it's going to come up in a joke or something, for me, for instance,  I usually say like n word or like something else instead of like the actual word itself.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10662,Um, I mean, I guess it like to be committed to a position like that.  I don't think I'm wholly convinced that it would make sense to draw a box around just  that word and then like every other type of racial slur or negative thing is okay except
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10679,for that one.  And then if I were to commit to a position where it's like, yeah, okay, I think something's  just shouldn't be in humor. They're just, they just shouldn't be joked about. I feel like you are very quick to basically get rid of all forms of like satirical or ironic like racial humor.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10695,I feel like that's slippery slope. I just feel like that word in particular, like I make a special exemption for it just because if we had to pick like one word that kind of is the embodiment of like how you could do damage with a single word, I think that's the one.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10709,I guess I just, I guess I just,  I just don't accept that.  I guess I just reject that.  Maybe we would have to go through it,  but like I don't feel like,  like I don't feel like the idea that if I told a joke,
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10722,like just saying n-word in place of the n-word,  all of a sudden like makes it more, I don't know,  that feels so silly to me.  I just can't, I don't know.  Like I would be more amenable to an argument where it's like,
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10733,don't make that type of joke at all,  rather than you can make the joke,  but just say n-word instead of the n-word.  Well, that's a good place to start because I'm just kind of curious on like how you conceptualize this.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10743,So like to you, if you had two people and they both told you a joke and one of them said N-word and the other one said, you know, the full thing,  would you not feel differently about the impact of both of those jokes?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10757,Well, yeah, of course. Like saying the actual N-word like or any like big like no-no thing or whatever,  like generally carries more of a punch with it, right? That's the whole point of that type of humor generally.  So that was going to be my next question.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10770,So there's a punch in using that word.  And that's what you're holding on to,  to want to continue to use it at this point.  Sure.  Okay.  Because that just seems like a weird thing  to wanna hold on to instead of just not saying.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10785,I don't think it's weird at all.  I'm very careful when I hear arguments  that start to get into like, that's weird,  or that's not cool.  I would argue the opposite for sure.  I think it's very weird that I could tell a joke
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10795,where it's like, so yesterday I saw a bunch of N words,  but that's okay as long as I don't say the N word.  I whole sail reject that, I don't agree with that.  But I think it's a lot less bad than saying,
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10805,hey I saw a bunch of N words.  I don't agree that it's less bad.  Even if I were to think of like racial usage of it,  like if I were to be like, oh, like I've got this  French Triax, he kinda acts like an N word sometimes.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10814,Like that makes me cringe almost as hard  as hearing the actual word.  Like that's super crunchy to me.  Yeah, so I reject that characterization.  Like well the humor is okay as long as you say  the N word instead of actually saying the N word.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10825,I'm not saying the humor is okay either.  I'm just saying that there is a difference  between self-centrorship and saying the N word  versus actually saying the N word.  And I think there's a considerable difference  between those two things.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10838,I feel like that might be true,  but I feel like if saying the N word is 100%,  then I think that using racial or edgy humor privately  is 95%.  I think you're basically already there.  The idea that you could say like,
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10852,oh well it's okay to say things like racial or edgy humor  as long as you like everyone understands that it's so much satirical that you're  not like being super serious about it  that's okay  uh... but you can't say the like a certain word that seems like a weird spot to
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10864,draw the line  it does but when people present in argument like it's a weird  when i saw a little bit more concise when yet it's not that it's a weird  spot to draw it is that it a whole trip completely arbitrary and i don't know
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10876,how you could justify that line there  well but  you you're saying that like forms of racial edgy humor that would never be  acceptable in a public form or that could be interpreted in a racist or hateful manner,  that's all okay. But saying the N-word is not okay because it can be interpreted in an
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10891,edgy or racist manner. Like that doesn't make sense to me. I don't buy that.  Right now I'm not trying to extend it necessarily all the way to like it's you know, especially  not allowed. Right now I'm just trying to figure out like there is a distinction, like
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10906,a significant distinction between saying N-word and like self-sensoring versus like actually  saying the word with the heart are.  When you say there's a distinction,  there's a distinction regarding what?  Like what is the distinction in?  In humor or in all forms?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10922,I think it's, so when I say distinction  and when I mean that has a big effect,  what I'm referring to is the effect  it has on people around you and like perceptions of you.  Cause I guess maybe that's where my brain goes most
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10934,of the time with work and stuff, but like,  so like if I told people or if people knew  that I did not self-sensor on the N-word,  I think that's a mental note that most people will take.  Like, hold the shit.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10948,They probably just like drop the N-word, the part R.  Like, that's kind of crazy.  And so like, they're going to have that same takeaway,  even if you tell them that privately,  I don't censor myself using that word.  I think like you could easily get out of this
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10961,by just even working on it.  Like, yeah, when I catch it,  when I know it's gonna come up, I'll try to censor it,  but I don't think that's something you honestly wanna do.  So I'm trying not to ask you to do that.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10971,Because I wanted to do that.  Wait, so you're trying to get me to acknowledge  that if people know I make a certain joke that they'll  think differently of me?  Because I acknowledge that, of course, for sure.  But do you understand why it is for that one special word?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10984,Because I don't feel like it's arbitrary.  Well, I mean, it depends on how we define the word arbitrary.  I mean, it is arbitrary.  But I mean, socially, that word is treated differently  than most of the other words, right?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,10995,Or than every other word.  But I mean, any argument you could  make for the N word like deductively logically  is going to fit for other words as well, right?  So for instance, like the G word for Asian people, right?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11005,Like we killed, there are tons of Chinese people  that died building the railroads.  We have a special history being like  discriminatory against Chinese people.  To be able to go back to a spectrum of bad.  I just think that the N word is it so far
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11014,on the spectrum of bad that I just typically  try not to use it.  Like, because we have to draw that line somewhere.  I don't think we do though.  Well, yeah, we don't have to.  Because it's your personal system.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11026,So no matter what, this is just a decision for you.  Like, and this is the other part of it that's difficult,  is the prescriptions or like the takeaways  that people have hearing you defend it  and they don't care what your defense of it is.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11038,It's like with this aerial thing where like,  I just think you've said something  or that you continue to defend something  that like has effects on people  who are not going to take it logically.  Like they might just hold on to the argument
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11049,that you have for that and some other arguments  they know of yours, use them in private  because most people aren't,  that when they hear a five-head take,  they're just gonna disengage.  And they-  Yeah, of course, but I mean like-
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11060,I've read further.  I mean, I'm as responsible as I can be.  Like I try to say as many times,  like this is how I believe this should be used.  I think I've even gone on record saying,  actually I know I have it,
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11070,and I'll say it again.  Nine times out of 10 when I hear a white person  trying to give an argument to defend  why they should say the N word,  most of the time it's just a racist guy.  I'm totally open about all these,
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11078,but I'm never gonna get to the point where  I'm actually gonna start to change a position  Because I'm like worried that somebody's gonna like misuse the argument  Yeah, like all I can do is just be as responsible when I'm messaging responsible. Oh, yeah, no, I would never ever do that
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11094,Well that that was that's kind of the prescription that you  Intuitively want to go to with that aerial chick is no not at all  Well, I mean like I heard you where you're like it's tough  she's slippery because like she doesn't want to acknowledge that like these
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11110,tweets that she's giving other people are taking them and running with them in  a different direction and she seems to even be aware of that at some level that  she's conservative baiting yeah but the difference is is like do you try to do
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11121,you do diligence in controlling that so like I know for a fact I know for a  fact that people have taken different arguments that I've made and have used  them in a negative manner and I've even joked about this so like for instance
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11130,a popular one that I used to give on Twitter is I don't think that sexual  content belongs on Twitch.  I actually don't, I don't think it does.  However, when I make that argument on Twitter,  every single time I do it, like everybody in my mentions
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11141,was like fuck these sluts that were tank tops,  fuck these whores that have like skirts on,  it's like whoa, hold on, like I have to be very careful  to qualify by my arguments because they will be used  in ways that I don't want them to be, right?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11150,But that's just something that like,  I mean that's a reality of being on the internet.  Like some level of people will misinterpret messages  or use them in a negative manner.  All you can do is like at least try to do your due diligence.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11160,Now when I look at Ariel's timeline,  She doesn't do her due diligence.  She's making the rounds on conservative talk shows.  She's being friendly to people like Steven Crowder.  She's got tons of misogynistic and transphobic comments  that are showing up in her own fucking Instagram.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11175,I don't think she's even trying.  Yeah, I checked that out.  Yeah, yeah.  Now, if she was constantly saying, hey, guys,  I understand that conservatives have a lot of problem,  but she's blatantly saying she'll like, oh no,  conservatives love trans people, stuff that's just not true.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11186,So I think there is a difference there.  Yeah.  OK.  So I'm just trying to paint a picture for how much of a cost is associated with this this one little take  Okay, I think if we can put enough pressure on it
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11200,Maybe that's what it'll take to like move the arbitrary distinction on like where we should like self-sensor and and like well  But like should I change like my take on like incest like because that's a really unpopular one as well
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11213,It is but I feel like that's like in  in an ideological argument thing.  And also, like, incest is not a topic  that's like attacking like a culturally,  I just don't think it's like a similar comparison.  I think the N-word take has grander consequences
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11230,than the other one.  Maybe, I don't know.  The incest one is like,  that's one that like people immediately point out,  like right along side everyone was like,  oh, Destiny, he supports incest.  He wants daughters, you know, fucking their dads.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11241,Like people will point that out immediately  when they talk about me like in other forms and shit.  I guess I wasn't compelled to spend hours and hours  about the incest thing,  but the unword thing feels like,  okay, this is just like an arbitrary line
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11253,that you have to draw at some point with your language  just to like, because it's a conscious or unconscious,  in either case, you're just choosing what words to use.  And I think you could just as easily choose to say N word.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11264,And it won't like, take away from these jokes.  And if it does, maybe you'll just like stray away  from those jokes if they don't work as well  without the hard R.  But I just think like we have to, like not have to again,
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11278,but you could draw this line anywhere.  So I think just like at least drawing it  to encompass the N-word and be like,  I'm gonna work on not saying it in private.  I think that's all I'm trying to get out of this.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11288,I disagree that it's a slippery slope though.  Like I think that you could very clearly draw a line  between like, okay, well, I don't wanna say this  we're in a private cause it's too offensive.  Maybe there are some jokes I shouldn't make in private
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11297,period because they're too offensive.  I think one really naturally and logically leads  to the other.  Yeah, if you want to.  But I mean, that's not really similar.  So it depends on how much it takes away from the joke.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11310,So if the punchline is the N-word,  I probably wouldn't say that one anymore  because it sucks without being able to say the N-word.  Well, so I mean, so I used to remember that Atlantis skit.  Have you seen the show before?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11323,No.  So there is an Atlantis skit  where there's a white guy quoting song lyrics or whatever.  No, no, no.  And so there's a white guy talking to Danny, is it Danny Glover?  I always fuck his name up.  Talking about how like, oh you know there was this DJ and he was playing this really
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11340,like bad music or whatever.  Fuck, hold on.  Oh my god, Darius just fucked me so fucking hard.  Sorry.  But the guy is telling his friend like, oh you know like I walked up to this DJ and  I told him, are you really going to play Flowrider again?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11359,And then he says, Edward with a soft A, but then he says it.  And the joke is that when Danny's character later on asks him to tell that joke again  to blacker friends, if that makes sense, when the white guy repeats the joke, he doesn't
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11377,use the word that time.  And that joke only works because he said it the first time.  Yeah.  So I mean, I think there are jokes that are impacted by the types of words, oh my God,  that we're allowed to use.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11388,But those are like professional  I mean, I don't want to go down that room  But yes, I get what you want to know we can go down that road because like you're treating me like a professional  Comedian person to some extent right like we have the same response because if I was just a private citizen and I had these
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11402,Pute points of view we wouldn't really care so we're treating me like okay  Well the reason why I'm less damaged. Yeah, but the reason we're personally did that I would call him out on it  Well, but you might not know because I might just not say it ever and then we could argue maybe not
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11414,They were like you like I saw on Twitter that they said like you know  I'm okay with using them private language and stuff. I'd be like that's interesting. I want to talk to them about that sure  I'm just hard-anting
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11428,Sorry to hear that no you're not sorry to hear that. Oh, dude. I'm getting soaked. I got camp self fucking hard by this fucking oh  Okay  So you so the the idea that like oh, it's a professional comedian that doesn't absolve anybody of anything like you wouldn't believe that argument
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11445,Yeah, so like yeah, because I could point to plenty of like famous comedians that have made really problematic jokes that aren't good  Regardless of them being a professional. It's not a logical thing  But it's it's how I'm used to talking with people I try to give them like a feel for something like oh sure
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11458,Yeah, but I mean any argument that I would make for or against like a  Comedian saying something I would use for a similar manner for myself because because we've all that public platforms  And that's where the problems are is are we responsibly using our public platforms?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11471,Yeah  Yeah, so um beyond that if you're a private citizen, and that's what I'm saying  It doesn't super matter to like the logical extent of  It's just I'm used to going to like panic dotes and stuff to like help contextualize stuff. Yeah. Yeah, I understand
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11489,Sure  So what was I saying? Oh, yeah, yeah, so it comes down to if it's problem. Yeah, wait  So we were talking about whether or not this could like is this a slippery slope or can we logically draw a line from one to the other?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11499,I would say that any argument you could use for not saying a particular word, right?  It's harmful people have negative reactions to it. It invokes a certain feeling. All of that could be said of like any type of racial
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11508,humor at all. Or any type of edgy humor.  You don't say? What?  Or anything you refuse to say?  No, of course not.  Especially like some of the stuff that's like the most taboo usually gets like is like the biggest like shocker in like a joke.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11520,It could be arguably, right?  But you don't want to say stuff that's not true, right? I think you kind of work at that  I mean there's a well it will you not true?  Cuz like technically no joke is true, right?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11531,I mean I don't just say so again like to be clear because apparently some people just like I don't just say like oh  I know this black person was talking. He's an inward. He's an inward. He's an like it's not like that right like it would
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11541,I can't I actually I don't even know 100%  I didn't even know if I know any jokes with the N word in him  I don't even know if I tell these jokes to be honest  Would you say that you do?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11549,Well, because I would defend the principle of it.  Like if I did know one that was really funny  or whatever and it worked with it, then I mean, I would.  I just don't know, I actually know any  or if I do this at all.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11557,I like this, I like this.  No, no, no, no, no, no, but that's not,  no, but that's not the argument I wanna make.  I'm not trapping you or anything.  Sure.  I like making a distinction between like in practice,
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11571,do I actually ever even say it?  If the answer is no, I would say that's really important  context to then saying  But like I personally never say it but I can understand from a logical standpoint  How someone doesn't want you restricting their private speech or whatever like to get that sounds so easily to me
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11591,That sounds like you're like you are unwilling to commit to a position. I don't like that  So you can understand logically where people so like I had to talk with my dad today. Yeah, he was like  the gun stores, the people are fighting about whether or not to close them.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11607,And I was like, well, if someone is honestly upset, you're restricting like their second  amendment rights and stuff and whatever.  And we have things defending the first and other amendments that are kept open as essential  services.  I don't think there's a big deal with just keeping the gun stores open.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11621,I don't think they're a huge part of like the social distancing and like other problems  that we have right now.  And so I would understand a bunch of arguments to keep those open.  So I'm not like I told them I'm like, I'm not just gonna like sit here and listen to you talk about how like they definitely should be closed
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11637,Because I don't think that's right  But if you ask me if you may be the governor or whatever  I I might just still choose to close them down even if I see like logically how we could arrive at a different thing
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11648,I think practically how you practice your logic is different than like the logic itself  Which lives out like your human action. Yeah, so I one million percent disagree that I  I really do try like I so I'm a very big believer
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11663,So a lot of people got really mad actually and I made the argument that like I put principles over friends  Like I'm a really big believer that a person is nothing without having some principal approach to something like I like I lose a lot of respect for people
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11674,Yeah, like if you have some principal position, but you don't live it then it means nothing to me  I'm it's one of the big things that like I like oh my god  Like I don't believe that words people say like it's how you what do you do?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11685,How do you act in life? Like I don't care what you argue how you argue whatever. Yeah, yeah, so  but I mean like  This again gets to what I'm talking about where there's an obvious distinction between like your beliefs and stuff
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11698,But then when push comes to shove, how are you behaving?  And I think there's like patterns of behavior you can take that don't show us the limits of what you allow yourself to do  So like it like if I had a dog and he was chained up in the yard
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11711,but he never like pulled so far as to like fully extend the chain.  I feel like a lot of people could come away not understanding how far that dog could go  if he never moves from the center of the yard.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11722,And I feel like if it like you want to define the fence,  you want to define how far that chain can extend before the dog gets stopped.  But if practically you never leave the center of the yard,  I feel like that's important to note.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11733,Yeah, but it feels like forever.  If you make these arguments, it feels like what you're trying to do is you're trying to have your cake and eat it too.  You're trying to say like oh well I would logically defend this position
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11742,But I would never do that like it feels like you're trying to stay in the good graces of people to disagree with it  While still putting forth an argument for people well  You can't say you'd never do it because that would be taking like a principal take
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11753,But I mean you can say like no, you know  I will defend people to the death for their right to be able to say blah blah blah and private speech  I think that's fine and like it doesn't you know
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11763,Mess with my system at all personally do I do that or like you know, am I just doing this?  you know, whatever, I don't.  And I think you said like, do I use this in private?  Or like, do I just use the N word all the time?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11774,Cause I feel like that's what it makes it seem like.  And I definitely don't.  I think a similar caveat, but just that like,  I honestly probably like, now that I'm thinking about,  don't ever really use this word.  And now that like my friends have like made it
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11786,a big deal to me personally, like,  because I have friends that are upset by it,  maybe normal people would go like, you know,  ah, like my friend, he told me like he was upset by it.  And so I personally try not to even if you believe other people should be allowed to like
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11801,Yeah, that's not a principle take it all then you're just doing whatever is most convenient  Okay, we could take out the caveat about trihex or a friend or whatever and just say like I will  Allow myself to say it. I don't think it's like logically unsound to say it or whatever
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11816,But personally do I ever use that no not really I  Yeah, I understand what you're saying. I just I completely and totally disagree like it's like saying like oh no  I just I totally fundamentally disagree like every bone in my body
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11828,I don't I just don't I remember that like I got really upset once because um I got into an argument with Hassan before and  We were talking about he gave the take you should never call the cops on anybody ever because they might deport the person because I might be
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11841,An illegal immigrant and I thought that was a very curious argument to make because I can think of several times where calling the cops is totally valid  It's not just capitalist defending their property and one of the examples I gave was okay
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11850,Well, let's say that you're a woman  and you're walking home at night,  and there were two guys following you,  thought you were gonna get like robbed or raped.  You think that person should call the police?  And his response to that was,
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11859,well, I don't think I would call the police.  What is that?  I don't believe that.  Wait, you don't believe what?  I don't believe he actually wouldn't call the police.  Oh yeah, maybe, but regardless of what he does, it doesn't.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11870,Like, it feels like you're trying to walk both sides of the line.  You wanna say like, oh, well, maybe it's okay,  but I know like, well, but I would never do it  to try to show like, so if somebody would ask me like,
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11877,oh, would you ever use the N word privately in a joke,  whatever, like my response is gonna be like,  yeah, if I knew jokes, if we're doing whatever,  like I would, I defend the position, like full stop.  Not like, well, I would defend it, but I would never do it.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11887,Like that sounds like you're trying to like play both sides,  like hardcore.  Well, you're just giving that person context, I feel like.  Like, I just wanna put this as an aside, you know,  while I'm giving this to you.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11900,Cause you're okay with giving context for other arguments.  So I feel like the context here,  I don't know why it's different.  I guess it feels weasily for sure.  but I think like that's because you're trying to look at it
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11911,at a different level than I mean for people to take it.  So like the reason I would include that caveat  are for people who are not looking at things  the same way as you.  So for people that are just listening at the surface level,
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11922,like I feel like that's an important caveat to have  and it really will change how they take the second part  of what's going on.  And I can agree with that.  So like I started like, I think halfway into this
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11932,we're realizing what it was going on  because I think the, because originally my position  is just that there's a different standard age  public and private to humor, which I think is kind of reasonable.  And then it basically that all boiled down to literally just the N word.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11943,I think later on I started-  I said all people care about it because it's the worst part of the whole shirt.  Yeah.  You just say private public, that's not what people are really arguing about.  Of course there's public private language.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11952,What they don't like is that you use the N word, that it comes off your lips.  Yeah, yeah.  Just kind of weird.  Sure, I understand it.  But later on I started to qualify a little bit more like, oh, like it's not like I say
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11964,this word blindly all the time.  I don't describe people like oh that guy is inward or whatever like yeah  I started to qualify a bit more because I realized how people were taking it sure  Okay  So it's probably so are we at a point now?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11976,We're like it's probably for the best of preface that you don't really use it much or is that still feel yeah?  I mean like wording yeah, I guess like depending on how it's qualified sure I can understand that
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,11988,Yeah, so like the incest one I think the best preface for the incest thing is to say so this is like an  intellectual exercise that I like to do with it all about what other is how you arrive at your conclusions about things
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12003,Incest is something where if you really think about it  You may have a much more nuance take than you normally would and that you know depending on what how far deep you go with that  You may come up with different conclusions. You may even flip flop
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12015,And so it's a fun conversation to have like I think people learn well  But like I still principally believe in the position though. These aren't just like logic. Okay. Okay  You didn't say that you didn't not you just said that like
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12028,For the so again saying this the caveat is for people who don't already have an intuitive understanding for what's going on  Sure, okay  I mean I think I have said those words before too like I did say that quite a lot like yeah
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12040,Because people ask like why are you so obsessed with instance like well usually other people bring it up  But if people want to talk about it, it's a good way to see like where do your morals come from or how do you generate like rights and wrongs?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12048,Yeah, sure. I like that it sounds a lot worse  So like if somebody comes up to me and like I just changed the way this is presented  Like it's some like hillbilly guys saying like, you know the way you really test your morals and your values we talk about
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12063,Incest I'll tell you what I'm pro incest like that's kind of the vibe  I feel like that people take when you combine those things in that order  Like we're gonna figure out about values by you convincing me that the incest is right like really destined
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12077,I don't feel like that helps you with the people that caveat is meant for  Maybe that makes sense  Yeah, I kind of understand intellectual exercise  I think they take it a lot less personally  They don't personally think that you personally believe in incest
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12090,And I think that gets it right off the bat and it makes it more fun because they're not combative  They don't feel like oh my gosh  this is an inherent societal value that we have.  I don't even understand why we have it at this point,
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12102,but I feel like I have to argue about it with this guy.  And if they don't know, it's like for fun and games,  I feel like it could be rough.  Sure, maybe.  So again, we're okay with the preface then on that inward take
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12119,on the private public language discussion.  That you can soften the globe by explaining your usage  a little bit more maybe.  Yeah, depending on how you phrase it. Yeah, as long as it doesn't sound too easily sure.  Yeah, because like with the incest thing too, like I
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12133,Some people will come away thinking that this dude definitely banged a relative  And like it's totally not the intent of it and it's probably something you never did  But because you made the job of a patient feels like
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12146,Well, I know so i'm saying like to to a rando. No, I understand. I know do me  Yeah, so like drawing that line usually the reason people are drawing lines morally and whatever is because they have crossed or like do not want to cross a line like they're already in that area.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12162,So like if you're saying things like I want to allow myself to do X Y and Z.  It almost feels like okay there has to be a reason he wants to allow that. Yeah, everybody uses they think everybody is engaged and motivated reason if you're arguing something it's because you want to do it.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12174,Yeah.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  I feel like that's all I really wanted to know.  Because a lot of this was like, does he actually use it a lot?  Because if he does, this is going to be a very different conversation.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12189,Sure.  And I would be suspect.  And I tell people, and I am like super clear with that, I think you should be suspect of  people that would like start to make these types of arguments.  Because oftentimes it's kind of like when somebody's like, oh, I'm a libertarian.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12199,It's like, oh really?  Like, what is some like really important parts of your stuff or whatever?  And it's like, let's talk about the age of consent.  It shouldn't exist like okay. That's kind of weird that that's like the first place you run to but
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12208,Yeah, let's take that to the other side of the fence though. Let's go back to practicality  So like we assume that they're practically using it and that's why this principle position is interesting  Like we're assuming something about that person but like
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12224,Again, that still applies duly to you  Sure, but I don't run to the end word part first like I always couch this is like this is a discussion  I have a difference in private department.  It's other people that want to make it about
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12234,the n-word immediately, right?  Which makes me wonder.  Yeah, that would kind of be like,  if I was debating a libertarian,  or somebody who's debating a libertarian,  the libertarian is like,  I think that the states should intervene a lot less
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12244,when it comes to like, you know, people's rights,  because I think it's an unjust hierarchy or whatever.  And somebody were to counter that, we go,  oh, see, you wanna fuck kids.  I would look at that person like,  well wait, hold on.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12253,Much the same, like when I say like,  oh, I think there's different stances  between a private and a public language.  And somebody immediately gets me like,  oh, you just wanna say the n-word prep was like,  Okay, I don't know why that's like,
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12260,that's the first place your fucking mind goes to, I guess.  But like, yeah.  Did you wanna talk at all about the Ariel or Ariel talk?  Yeah, I do.  That's really interesting,  but I wanna have like a dedicated like focus conversation.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12273,I want to play a link about it.  My name like take away, my main question.  I tried to be like pretty like nice-ish  in that conversation.  I didn't wanna come up.  I'm sure you can tell like super combative,
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12283,but like she's also like really slippery.  So I'm not entirely sure.  Yeah, I'd be curious to get your feedback on that.  Yeah.  Dude, it's so hard, because I don't know if it's slippery,  or she actually has a really good, I mean,
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12295,because I don't know enough about this stuff.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  When I say slippery, that implies intent.  I don't mean that she's intending to be slippery.  That's just like, it's very hard to nail her down to something.  But they might be her genuine position.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12305,That's why I said at the end, I don't know  if she's arguing in bad faith.  Like she's really trying to like.  She's ready for everything.  But then I go to her Twitter, and she definitely  knows what she's doing.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12314,And she admitted as much in like Paul.  But she's bathing people.  God damn dude, I'm fucking popping off!  But yeah, for sure, it's a really hard one.  And that idea of identifying people that are operating in bad faith
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12331,or people that are just kind of dumb can be very, very challenging.  I mean, yeah, it could be.  I mean, so at the very beginning, she started giving you...  She was really good in the beginning,  When she broke down ID into these four parts,
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12348,the biological, physical, emotional, and social,  I thought that's where you guys were gonna discuss.  I feel like there's a lot to go on there.  Yeah, I tried it, but it felt like every time  I pushed on something, immediately,
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12358,something she said prior would give.  Like she would say things like, oh fuck,  maybe if you go through the conversation,  maybe you can find things where I felt like,  she would say one thing, like, oh, well,  your experience in being a woman,
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12368,well, if you look like a woman, you know,  these are things that are part of your experience.  And then when I'd be like, okay, well, what about,  women that don't necessarily look like women?  She's like, well, that's not important now because we have
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12376,the other three dimensions or two dimensions.  And I was like, but why can't we do that for?  It felt like she kept going back to suit the argument,  to say that cis women never need to prove their gender,
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12384,but trans women have to prove all the dimensions constantly  or something.  It was really hard to like, it felt like she was being  inconsistent, but maybe I missed something.  I don't know.  Well, yeah, that was the thing.  Why is it important to test?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12395,Why is it important to make?  Like, where is the importance of making  a distinction between people who come into being trans  for people who like, we can look at their brain and see it.  Like, I don't see what the benefit is in separating
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12407,these people beyond on the internet where-  Well, the ultimate thing that she brought up  was that she needed to protect,  I think she said, I remember coming to the sound of my nose,  she said we need to protect the concept of woman,
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12416,or something, the concept of womanhood,  that if we let too many trans people in,  we're gonna lose that.  I think I asked her at one point,  like what's so valuable about that concept,  like what would happen if we were to change how it was?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12426,I don't remember what her answer was,  but I'm sure it's on her sound.  But we're asking for the abolition of gender  while also defending the fundamental ideas of the whole.  I don't know if she's asking for that.  Oh.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12437,I don't think she'd say that she's gender abolitionists  at the end, didn't she say that?  Did she?  If she did, I don't remember it.  Get rid of that and bring it to the sexes  and then trans people will just identify
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12447,with the sex that they feel is,  because it's all, they're trying to get rid  of the gender part of it, that's my understanding.  I don't think she wanted to say that.  No, I don't think she wanted gender abolitionism at all.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12456,I don't think so.  I could be wrong, but I don't think so.  But okay, I'm gonna go back to my league step  Then we can have a more detailed conversation with that as someone okay sounds good. Let me know right? I look
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12467,My grow Dan no, Japan my grow oh  Darius for fucking 30 fucking dirt 30 that fuck 90 seconds  I said a dragon waiting for you waiting for you.

vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12691,on the toilet having a poo and then suddenly you're like, Oh, yeah, I guess I'll come to  It's one of those moments.  Fucking people picking ranged people against my Darius is getting real annoying  Why do you think Trinity is better than blooded drinking? Whoa, I never said that. Oh
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12713,Then why are you obsessed with Trinity for is well because it was the point you brought up earlier and I said  But every guide says to build you said why are you building Trinity force on trundle?  That's your exact quote from chat. Yeah, and I and I said uh
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12726,And I said why every guy says to build it on them  You didn't make any qualifier beyond like that  You're I kind of did stall on that because I was talking about other people too. I don't know  But um, you can't go like two damage items on trundle, right? Like you don't get that much gold
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12742,No one gives a fuck about league  Then  Fuck off  No one cares. This is why there's no Japan for you Dan  That's not about how you got destroyed in tender heart then it never paid me by the way
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12758,Dan I'm still waiting for my $30  I'm still waiting for my 25% of everything that you owe me moving forward for the rest of your career because without me you're fucking nothing  You want to go down that road Darius?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12769,Holy shit dude relax, Dan  He's right, but I do actually own 25% of my earnings  wait what wait so I'm not a fucking joke are you housing him though I gave me a contract  and I okay I'll be honest I was wonder Dan's been feeling hardcore for you dude I haven't
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12792,been saying no league is kind of like a detriment to Darius so so this is why destiny  has been playing league with me and ironic because I actually last month I couldn't pay  I'll be honest. I was lacking at work. I told Dan. Hey, dude
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12808,I will start streaming and everything like that for like a grand so I can pay my rent and  For a grand you gave up 25% for how long how long cartoon I don't remember  I don't think it's forever it is forever

vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12856,This is why you read Darius. If you read you,  what am I telling you right now?  Darius, I'm telling you right now.  You try any shit.  Read your fucking contracts, you dumb fuck.  Oh, it's too late now.  Dumbass.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12867,Darius, you have like a wealth.  You probably had to learn everything.  You have a wealth of information at your hands,  indeed, and you didn't have one person look over a contract for money?  If what is, what is, okay, if I'm making a million
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12881,in a year now from streaming. What is 250?  Okay, that's a lot of fucking money.  That's a lot of money.  That's a lot of money.  Dariels, you know what's going on in you right now?  A bunch of fucking beta orbiter has beens
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12894,that will never make it on Twitch telling you,  oh, Darius, how could you do that?  Listen, you're going to be the next ninja  and I'm going to be there managing you the whole way.  Darius, just think of this.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12904,He's not taking the advice for when he's doing  with contracts and shit. He's not doing this thing.  The first thing he does is call his fucking lawyer  and says dog here it is read it up dance not doing this shit not you're getting
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12913,fucking gaslit right here in front of five thousand people wait it's a leak  stream three thousand four hundred people do I also have to get the star  David tattoo of my back I want you to be the most successful you you can be I
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12929,let me be honest Darius who believed in you more than me and I want you to take  a step back okay let's go back a few months ago a few months ago I was  shilling Darius before there's even a contract in hand.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12940,And I think I would say to Destiny,  hey, you know, you should play League with Darius.  And I was like, who's Darius again?  Is that the movie streamer?  Those are the exact words out of his mouth.  Now look at you.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12948,You're being like propelled into fame and success  because of the hard work that I've done  putting you out there.  And you think that's free?  You think that's nothing?  Do you know where you would be without me?  You ever watched a pimp talk to his hooker?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12961,This is what's happening right now, Darius.  Don't take this shit.  No, actually there was a girl  who sent me boobies because I was on the Rod Show and that was because of  Harkton. So honestly, I think it's all worth it.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12973,Yeah, by the way, you know, even though you got fucked, who else got you on the  last Rod Show as well?  Uh, fucking Lycan.  No, that was me.  You dumb fuck.  Off that one.  Sure. But yeah.  That's why it's the last one you dumb fuck.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,12988,You got to think of the residual follow on effects of me getting them on that last one.  Coming back to his fucking roots.  All right.  next  this is him no Darius made the best way we use spam queuing while I was okay
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,13014,so we have a dime time for three minutes good job yeah I did you I'm kind of thing  I asked a Darius about the contract what is the contract nothing Steven it's  none of your fucking business all right not everything of revolves around you
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,13030,just play Lee  I'm gonna go back to eating.  Go like guys.  That's fun.  Great.  Don't forget that NDA.  All right.  No terms of that contractor to be read.  Don't worry.  Dan's NDA is an ever enforceable because he's too much of a pussy to ever take you to
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,13052,court.  So you're fun.  That's true.  Except this fucking Darius so I know he can't afford anyone.  I'll be if I could just not show up the court.  I will present myself.  You dumb bastard, you have to have enough money to fucking have an uber ride to get to the courthouse.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,13066,So you're already fucked.  I ain't...  Alright, see.  Like him?  Yeah, what's up buddy?  Are you gonna be on the next rogeroyo?  I don't fucking know, man.  I believe you need to do it.  You have a sway to get me in and you can get yourself in.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,13098,I'm one of Raj's backup girls.  Is that true?  When he doesn't have someone, he's like, ah, fuck.  All right, like him.  Harken, do you ever talk to that?  Like, my Lafayette Jinx girl?  No, I didn't.  But I was, she said that she loves the ATAB streams.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,13116,And I was like, wait, what?  Really?  I was like fucking shocked.  I mean, no, not even a destiny person either.  And she's like, I fucking love watching Dan.  Which is, that's kids get a bit from their house.  I was like, who is this one?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,13129,It's so weird that there's a person that knows you  that's not related to destiny at all.  It's weird that there's people in my community even.  That's weird to even say that I have a community  that don't know destiny at all.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,13140,It's will make fun of guys for giving away money to girls,  but clock into work every day.  And Tinder streams.  And give away their surplus value to their employers.  So who's the real simp here?  Wait, fuck.  I'm sorry, hold on.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,13155,I have like real life stuff.  I need to go start my dishes on the dishwasher  because I have no clean dishes,  hold on a beer bag on a sec, sorry.  Don't spam fucking queue, you sell 44 seconds.  All right, make sure you go get that one cup,
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,13165,one plate, one fork and one hour.  Oh, true.  Why do you even need a dishwasher  when you have that shit, bro.  I mean, did he have a dishwasher?  I thought his place didn't even come with it.  I'm surprised he does.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,13184,He doesn't have the, yeah.  He has a fridge.  I would've used his.  Imagine having to go to a laundromat.  Like that's ultimate fucking peasant status.  Like it doesn't get lower than that.  It's like, hey, I'm gonna go wash my clothes.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,13195,Hold on.  Let me go get some quarters.  If you can drive.  Dude, that sucks.  Dude, it sucked enough living in the barracks  and having to go downstairs and do your laundry.  I mean, living with other men, that's the worst.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,13219,Oh, mother talking.  In unit is way worse than a laundromat, Dan.  Okay.  Yeah, you're fucking communist. Yeah, right in unit mean  Darius is so poor. He doesn't even understand the concept of  What do you mean washer dryer? Stop it. Dan. It was me
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,13243,Darius it's too hard of a concept for you to ever understand. It means it's like having a washer and dry in your house  It's in your apartment. Oh  Oh, well, I was like, having your own.  I would just say in unit.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,13255,Because that's the professional term for it.  Oh, shit.  In unit washer dryer.  You'll see that on your apartment thing.  When you're no longer poor, because you're  going to be a millionaire and Sue Dan for his half  of the contract and then you leave a bunch of other shit.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,13271,I'm probably out to sue him for tortious interference.  Good luck with that, kid.  You fucking come at me in the slightest.  I will drown you in paperwork.  I will own that a 25% I will own a hundred percent you'll be working just to pay off my shit forever
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,13285,You understand eight more  You need for you need the loose and say I understand Darius even spend enough time to make a good tinder bio  I doubt you're gonna spend enough time to even write up Darius  Have you seen some of my past work when I get a little bit frisky?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,13299,I saw your past work last time you lost  No, no, that's not what we're talking about. I'm actually motivated to make something happen. Oh good  Do you want to be on the end of this work?  Darius, do you want to be on the end of that?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,13310,Why can you tell me what your previous work is?  I mean, there's so much to point that.  And apparently I don't even know where to start.  Name one.  Parting of the Red Sea?  That was Dan.  That's true.  Dude, why don't I hate that I have to keep refreshing chat
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,13331,in order to see what they're saying.  I think I should just be on band.  RTV, please un-band me.  Dan, you're such a smooth talker.  You are wealthy.  You've been successful.  And yet, no Japan.  I'm getting some Niko vibes here, huh?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,13355,Wait, if I log out, does it actually work?  No.  the  half  did yesterday ,  Is it like maybe like maybe you in a laundromat and the people up there have cell phones with high data plans?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,13389,Is that it?  Okay, I have a important car question. Okay, ready?  Okay  So I so a while ago a couple months ago one of my tires was just completely flat  I don't know what happened if I ran over something or whatever
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,13406,But I had to get two new tires basically because I didn't want to just get one for my car  I got a I popped a warning today saying that my I have low tire pressure and  When I go to measure like the tire pressure of all four my tires the two new tires that I have are like
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,13423,It's I think under inflated, but I can't inflate either of them  Is there like a thing with new tires that makes it so there's something special you have to do or  Why not? So like when I go to the inflate the tire, so I check both of my back ones, right?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,13442,And I checked the, I stick the thing in and it pops up and it's like 45 or 46 or whatever my tire pressure is supposed to be a PSI.  I check both of them. I can fill both of them. That's fine.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,13452,But when I go to check both front ones, when I stick the thing in, it looks like it's coming out like 23 or 24,  But I can't fill it with air at all. It's like not going in when I squeeze the thing it like goes to the side or comes out
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,13464,Or some shit  Do you try to go into a different place like maybe that one place is things broken?  Well, I mean it worked for my back ones  Same model player across all of them I think but I mean
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,13481,It's probably a problem with the stem on the tire like I had problems with both front tires and both back ones I  I take it back to the tire shop.  Yeah, maybe fuck.  I hope they're open.  Did you
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,13515,I'm not sure if I can measure the pressure,  those sensors fuck up all the time.  Well, they worked on both my back tires  and they didn't work on the two front new tires.  46 PSI is high, no.  I thought it was.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,13525,I thought PSI anything, I thought that like 30  or something was a memo recommended,  but I checked the recommended for my tires  maybe because they're like 40 tires or whatever,  but on my car, the recommended is like,  it's either 43 or 40, it's some like super,
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,13536,it's some ridiculously high.  the  early for me it's ridiculously high when i looked at i think it was forty six p s i from my focus  since it sounds high but  you have all seasons on their summer time fuck now i've never ever use all seasons
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,13559,the other summer times  I don't think anybody should ever use all season tires.  Okay.  What?  I was directed at you Darius, because you laughed.  Yeah Darius.  What? No. Okay, so there's one guy who, all my subs are from one guy,
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,13585,and he posted a message in my Discord that says,  I can't believe 25% of my subs are going to Dan rip.  I guess I won't be subbing anymore.  So I was joking, okay?  If you're here, here's a lie.

vPeG7O488v8,20200331,15634,do  five  Going to work somewhere.  Sorry. I was getting yelled at.  Um...  Did that again, Destiny?  I'm not saying that, like...  HIPAA means that they can't look at their records  without you giving them permission.  It doesn't mean they can't ask about it.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,15665,Uh... I think there are certain things  they're not allowed to even ask for.  Like, there's no requirement for them  you just divulge that, like,  how's the conduit to your job?  It's not about it being required!  It's about them asking!
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,15676,If I want a fucking girl, and I say,  Hey, do you have HIV?  And she's like,  You can't even demand that yeah, of course I can't demand that but I can ask they can I imagine you're probably asked
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,15685,Were you sick? Do you have corona? They don't they can't demand it?  They can't look at your records that you see but if you don't want to respond  They'll be like oh, I don't know they can like okay, well, we're just gonna fucking fire your ass
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,15693,I think that's okay. Thank you. I can get out of here  Dan shut up  Okay, first go don't take your league shit out for me  Second of all give me one second and I will get you an answer to that. Okay. Thank you
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,15708,because I'm pretty confident that they are not allowed to even ask for it but I  will verify yeah let's do that okay just verify it  I  Guess fuck do you walk over to me? I'm dead anyway, dude  Not yet.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,15738,Not yet.  Not yet.  I'm not a real dude.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,15772,That's a  Don't like me shit. I don't care  I'm like 99% positive that an employer is allowed to ask you medical questions that are necessary for you to do work  I'm almost know that's true like you can't fucking fill out an application online for fucking work
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,15794,And then like oh cool  You want to be like a new loader at the fucking doc awesome and you show you fucking wheel yourself in to the fucking job site  Like oh by the way, I'm fucking handicapped hope that's not a problem
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,15805,Like I'm almost positive. That's not a thing. Okay. I'm sorry. I love you like him  For someone that actually works in the in a chart to give me an answer, but the Chris reread says that  And an employer can ask about a medical condition if necessary
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,15822,It might affect your jibber. Yes, you need to do their job. Yeah, that sounds about right. Yeah  So if there's a quarantine going around and you said that you got something about Corona  My jobs are working  You got this if you're working from home, then why would they ask you anything about your fucking testing for Corona Darius?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,15845,Because I that's why I took off a work  Even  But I fucked up really bad anyway because I I heard so I didn't know anything about the testing  Can you walk me through the conversation where they're like,  how did you test on your dude on your thing, dude?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,15862,Since I know you're working from home.  Can you please walk me through that conversation?  How did it? Yeah, go.  They called me and they were like, hey,  Darius, we noticed that you requested this day off to go get a Corona test.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,15871,Okay.  So we're just wondering if you have like any documentation for that.  And I was like, uh, yeah, I do.  Um, why did you run from him?  I hate this fucking game.  Why would you run with the unclones?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,15885,He's begging to die.  Oh my God.  Oh, it's amazing.  Oh, he dies anyway.  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  Down with the sickness.  I'm not there at all.  So good luck, dude.  That's all you, man.  This just gave this game is way too much for me.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,15905,Go.  I'm here now.  Go.  Go.  They want to die.  They both want to die.  Gutter.  Gutter.  Don't miss.  Yes.  Good.  just run it down.  You're welcome.  I saved that for you by the way.  You're happy now?  But anyway, I've got enough.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,15935,Okay, so the question is, does an employer have a right to see a doctor's note if you  took time off for work.  Now my guess is going to be, since there's specific policies  relating to like FMLA, like family or medical leave of absence,
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,15952,my guess is going to be, since there's special provisions  for that, they're probably allowed to ask for proof  that you actually had said medical condition  or actually went to the doctor.  That's my guess.  No, maybe it's not that way.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,15963,I don't know.  can employer ask for proof doctor visit time off sickness.  Let's find out.  Let's check.  Maybe they can't.  That would be the question we would look up though.  And while you looked at it up, I think one of my things
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,15981,that I kind of got jumbled in my head  was I was also thinking of explicit medical records.  So it's pretty easy to like, hey, doctor,  can you write this thing and say, hey,  I came here to get tested.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,15992,I could find a doctor to do that.  But he wouldn't have to provide any like concrete records of it.  Sure, maybe not.  Let's check.  Unpaid time off may result in the employer requiring proof of illness.  So they can ask.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,16015,Are we done?  Can we move on from this?  Yeah.  Okay.  I'm like in, no, don't apologize.  Listen, I'm just, I'm playing league and when daddy plays league, he just,  gets like this okay i'm sorry for shouting at you okay i'm sorry pup pup please don't pull up the
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,16030,switch again  well anyway um i heard trump say that it took them like 40 minutes and they asked me how long it  took me and i said yeah like 40 minutes so i thought that's how long the process was supposed to do but
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,16047,But, it was not the case.  No, okay.  It's not smart enough.  The whole move's like this off, okay?  Just be a chill kid again, okay?  Stop.  Why not just say you have a fucking cold?  Why would you lie?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,16060,Because I thought we were getting paid time off.  Or it's what we were.  Paid time off for cora, oh, you actually are fucking  yourself then, you're just fucking stupid.  Oh, okay, my bad.  You were just trying to gain the fucking system.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,16072,Okay, now I understand more, okay.  So you were going for some special Corona fucking exemption or some shit.  Yeah, they when they come when they weren't doing it.  If you were, if there is a special provision for people specifically with Corona to get
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,16086,paid time off due to a sick leave.  Well, no, not for the, it was for people to go get the test.  Twitch is about to kill me and I'm going to get triggered for it.  Never mind, no he's not.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,16095,Fuck Twitch.  Yeah.  Um, I'm 95% the Darius is going to be on a future.  the  reason that republicans have the talking points to do  well he's actually the reason the democrats of the talking words because  dairies probably makes decent money but he uses system

Look at me bringing this one back, eight and four guys.  So Darius, what did the odds you get laid off completely now for the stunful fault?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,16322,Um, zero.  Well, he can't get laid off because it sounded like he's not actually employed by them, so  he's just contract work.  So he doesn't actually get fired out late off.  They just contract him for some number of hours.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,16331,Oh yeah Darius, are you a contractor or are you an employee?  I would be a contractor, I'm pretty sure.  Ohhh.  Yeah, I guess you're like an employer.  I can't find an app driver for tech support.  Technically, we're not like companies.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,16346,Uh, like it's not Apple, it's like the company that I work for.  So you're not actually a contractor of Apple.  You're a contractor for a subcontractor that Apple uses.  This is literally, I think this started with like, uh, I'm a...

vPeG7O488v8,20200331,18772,community building skill shots? Yeah I  love Ari. It's a well designed champ. Ari  and Orianna. I love mids that have like  skill shots and shit. They're fun to play  around. They're satisfying when you get  kills with them. So much better than the
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,18782,majority of the mids today that are made  for fucking League have like no fucking  skill shots. Most of their shit is  fucking face roll. Zoe I think is fun to play against. That's a new one that has  like, scale shots, her damage is insane but...
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,18809,Don't you dare call Zoe fun to play against? I like, I would rather play  I'm gonna say I get some millions of Zoes than like fucking any other I don't know  I like champs like you can play around that you can like dodge their skill shots and shit like that's fun for me
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,18821,I like that they don't have like untargetables and stuff. I don't know. That's I think it's funny  But Zoe's damage is pretty high sure I  I  Have the item now fate. Are you ready to see me go?  Get a penta
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,18845,Yeah, like plan I'd rather like it's a million Zoe's fucking said  Dude, so fucking boring  That is like one of the few champs like everything that League like makes League fucking horrible  I mean, at least that doesn't have untargetable, I guess.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,18860,Holy shit.  I understand.  I have the blade.  Here he comes, boys.  They weren't ready.  Wait, wait.  They don't know I have it.  I'm yelling you.  Press W!  You really stole that kill from me.  Don't worry, we can damage him eventually.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,18903,Give me this item now.  I walked into that I deserve to die in a video game  We can do bear whatever you're ready  Are we's gonna come for this blue and then we're gonna fight her okay?  Yeah.  Yes, I'm going to try.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,18932,Wish me luck.  Hope to God this isn't worth it.  Oh, never mind.  She's not working.  You want to do, we can do a Baron.  I'm going to go into Shenaix here real quick.  If you fail, come Baron.  Fail to Ant or?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,18951,Fail to do anything really.  And it looks like you did that.  So.  Nice.  Nice.  Okay, I'm out of here.  Oh, I'm getting, they have like so much vision shit.  You make two seconds.  Okay.  Look at the damage we're gonna do.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,18977,Oh, you're just gonna walk away from it?  Like a fucking run.  That's okay.  No, that's great.  Their entire team is set.  That was their entire team.  That one guy down there?  the  it's fine by the way  push and tap push and tap

vPeG7O488v8,20200331,19032,Lucian, you have a fucking dash. Why would you take the lantern when I'm standing here?  Fuck you, Ari. Not this time. Oh, Vel'Kaz though, yes.  Okay. At least we almost got the top turret. Nice job.  Alright.  We're doing it slowly.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,19056,Oh, Mountain Drake, go get that.  Yep.  What is the top champ you'd like to play against because of skill?  Any champ with lots of skill shots is a lot of fun for me.  Lux's, Aries, Oriana's...
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,19086,I don't know I'm sure that Zoe I like playing against ice come from me. I know it sounds weird  At least can be fun dodge the stun  Velkaz can be fun even though he's got a lot of spells and he does so much damage
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,19105,Not fizz fizz has an untargetable and a strong point and click fuck fizz and his and his stick barely counts as a skill shot  fuck fizz this is a cancer champ to play against I don't think I can ever kill

vPeG7O488v8,20200331,19692,Where is Lucian doing all of this?  Wait did he die at Baron?  No, he just showed up.  like this theory  and  safety
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,19724,as  faith  of two lanes  you guys can't fucking move the game  probably  the night carries you know he's a fucking ranger
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,19755,go to break  this is last year please i think we're not going to get echoes already there  We're all AD2 and Echo.  Let's build Dead Man's Plate.  Oh, can you kill him? He doesn't have any mana.  Do you want to push bottom as 5 and get something? Or is Lucian going to slip, mid?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,19787,Okay, just be somewhere where you're applying pressure and we'll try not to die, okay?  Oh, no, no, no  This for real wait  Okay, so you picked like one of the few spots on the map where no matter what it's just bad to be there
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,19821,But congratulations on that it's like a fucking where's Waldo of bad decisions and you managed to find him every fucking time  I think you would have won there  If you showed up, which you did well  That's because I was in one of the areas that I said we should be in just applying pressure. Guess what doesn't apply pressure red buff
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,19845,Hey  Oh my god, I was not watching  I'm getting fucking zoomed around the map so much. I am not following it  I have to get here.  What is Lucian doing?  Okay, guys.  Remember at the end of Samurai Champloo where the guy gets stabbed just to win the fight?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,19875,Wait, I'm going.  He's so slow.  Oh no.  This is not that, okay.  That was so unnecessary.  There's a minute 36 on all the objectives, so like it's not a big of a deal.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,19907,That's okay.  I have no idea why you just said that.  Why did...  Listen, it's all good, don't worry.  I feel like we're gonna win this one, okay?  That's all that matters at the end of the day.  Hey, does CDW's just travels at all?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,19921,Fuck no. Why, what's going on?  Um, I wanted to talk to them about having email team captains.  Don't they already have like half email, half mail?  No, there's never been a female team captain for the random...  The random are the... what's it called?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,19942,Hasn't Pokemon been like... team captain or who?  No, like...  He should be.  But no, it's the drafted ones.  The ones where there's team captains and then they draft.  Huh.  How do they choose who the captains are?  They choose it based off Elo and viewership.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,19962,And there happens to not be a lot of like...  Girls that have high low and high viewership, but I mean there still are  Like you've on and like there's a bunch of other girls as well, but they're never captain
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,19977,There's girls that have like one to a tribals and been really high up  They don't even sign up for rivals. I believe you won. Yeah  One problem is that my guess is that the drafts are probably supposed to be like fairly equal in terms of skill
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,19994,So if all the captains are like challenger rank men and then you have like like a female captain. It's like diamond one  Oh my god  Hi didn't press R. Fuck  Where I think we're gonna lose this I think we deserved I mean I even know it's fucking going on this game
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,20018,You should  just not fighting for me at all  just need some weird mineshows  just a few years ago  just a few years ago  just a few years ago  you're fine are we gonna if we lose this next drink they get dragon for that sucks
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,20054,so hard for us yeah it's the it's the remountains pretty bad he died oh we're  gonna lose can you protect that you think it's just the enemy bot easy why are you  running right into the Velka shit okay run a drink run a drink run a drink
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,20074,Okay, let's see, I suppose if you want.  What did you think about it?  Because I heard you say something, but then you didn't have to keep...  Hold on.  Yeah, I'll wait.  You're so lucky.  Holy shit.  Good job.  That wasn't good, I was just fucking blind, fucking rock.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,20119,Alright, we win next fight, okay?  Okay, we need to be careful.  We have to wait for Lucian, we have to wait for Lucian, we have to wait for Lucian.  Alright, we're going to do this.  I love the block.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,20147,Whatever.  That goes right over here, behind you.  We do bad. I'm dead. Is there a jungle echo? Yeah, there's a jungle echo, but I know  I think he had the back  I'm not going to get anything so that's what I'm going to do.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,20173,I'm not going to push with three down.  Oh, we're going to keep going back.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,20238,Dude, if you get all the Velkaz out of his ult, that would actually be so fucking helpful.  And please, can you be with us instead of standing in the jungle looking for some  real dumb shit?  Nice!
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,20270,Okay, I don't know why you're all hand-based.  Easy.  You got that?  That great autos everyone, let's see.  Yeah, honestly.  I can't have zoned out.  I feel like the engine's been over a long time ago.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,20300,Jesus Christ.  What do you name your new grief set build?  Okay first time it wasn't griefing.  Second off, it was doing pretty good early.  early. Third off. I'm sure I'm at 50. Yeah. It's like three more games and then it's in
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,20340,promos. Are you promos again? Yeah.  Well, if you get the if you get the  plus three eights fine. It's fine.  Go.  Oh, sorry. So, like, let's say that all five team captains exist and then four team captains  are like challenger level male players and then one team captain is like a diamond female player.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,20371,When they go to draft the teams are probably always going to be uneven. That sounds like pretty  awkward. So I'm supposed to have a meeting soon. My take was what they did was allow people to have  a certain amount of players designed around their specific elo. So say the higher elo
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,20390,So, captains were given a fair amount of MMR players, whereas a diamond one person were  given a higher elo of people to pick from in their pool.  Maybe if you break out all the players into different categories of ranks or whatever,
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,20408,and then you can only think about it.  That's what I was doing.  Yeah, that's what I was thinking.  As long as they don't think it's too complicated.  Yeah, because I spoke to so many girls that were in the two tribals scene and a lot of
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,20419,them are upset that there is basically, I mean, little to none.  They don't even expect girls to play and the one that's complicated or not  complicated, but more like competitive.  Yeah.  And I was talking to a player that, you know, actually gets to play in these
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,20434,where it's a lot more competitive and they were saying that the higher Elo  ones are a way for, I mean, people to like scout like tournaments and stuff.  Because there's not many tournaments that get broadcasted and are able to show
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,20446,like tournament play.  from like solo queue players. Yeah, yeah, exactly.  So they're saying it's like an opportunity for those players to like show off to orgs and stuff.  Yeah, but I don't know. Because they do have the all random draft one or not draft one but.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,20467,Oh, good luck.  Great.  I'm just wondering if it's even like worth it, I guess.  I'm not arguing. Why not? It's always worth it to try, right?  Worst case scenario, they say no.  Best case scenario, you make a difference.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,20483,Well, worst, worst case scenarios, you have a female captain,  and she's the only other person that drops females because  are women because everybody else just wants to draft the best players,  and then they get fucking crushed, and then you get Team Cyber in 2.0,
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,20493,and then people blame you for it. That would be the worst case, so.  I think that sucks the most is like the players that do choose  like females to be on their team, be they call it a simp.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,20502,Sure. That's always going to happen as long as women are in the minority of the scene.  All right, we'll go chill out for the rest of the night, but it was nice talking to you  Darius win carry him because he's like hard to suck and piss low no we all are
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,20536,but be nice what you heard me I said be nice we're all low elo though sure okay  Okay, you too. Especially everything going on.  Yeah.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,20579,So here is who fighting with people in chat?  Oh, he's fucking tabbed out.  AFK so it probably is funny if you're an idiot don't want us to go up.  Well, yeah, let's figure it out....  I've only gotten more art into my positions, but I do think it's funny that all these folks
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,20614,that one day or like keep your third eye open,  manufactured consent are the same ones  who fall the fastest for these ploys to demoralize the lab.  Oh, if anything, I've only gotten more ardent  in my positions, but I do think it's funny
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,20627,that all these folks that one day are like  keep your third eye open, manufactured consent  are the same ones who fall.  Damn.  I don't know what it means.

vPeG7O488v8,20200331,20820,It's around the same like 3k or something.  Yeah around 3 to 4k.  It's gonna be, it's gonna skew a little bit higher and a lot of people are gonna say,  well actually you had up 4.5 can stuff a lot playing zoom, which I did, but that's because
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,20846,on a lot of the days this past week I've led with like debates and stuff.  Like I had a lot of viewers, but then I would bleed them off  Yeah, and you know that hosts with Raj. Yeah, yeah
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,20854,Like there's a lot of stuff like that going on so people look back at the numbers  But like well actually destiny got it  But like if you actually follow them like if I started doing like right now  Like I would probably lose some viewers and stabilize around like 2.5 to 3.5k around the same
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,20864,X  Fuck, I thought I had her with that bomb.

vPeG7O488v8,20200331,21163,Okay, I never go down to 1.7. K. If you're just playing league  That's like if I start my stream at like 10 o'clock and it's like okay. Let's play some league games, right?  You guys suck at interpreting data. I know because I look at the numbers all day

vPeG7O488v8,20200331,24351,So fucking stupid.  What's your LP at?  Um, I'm at 86, so one more game and it's promo time.  Okay.  Can I take like a three minute break to go make soup?  Yes.  Okay.  I miss the soup time meme.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,24383,Where'd it go?  Ugh.  Alright, do you think Darius ever lets his dog out ever?  Yes.  She goes out in the morning, goes out at night, and sometimes on Sunday is if we go to the park.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,24419,Super more like poop. That's actually really funny.  Darius eats his dog's food, so probably not. I don't eat my dog's food.  He eats his lane more than his- okay. Who said that, Kogasa?  There's your band anyway time to plug.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,24438,I'm going to stream after we've done the league.  Tinder, Tinder and talking.  I might do an eager let GG game tonight because I'm feeling a little frisky.  Quarantine's got me a little isolated.  So I might purchase a friend for the night.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,24457,A lady of the night per se.  Darius, you're bad at league and bad at lying. No.  Darius, go and stop whoever is raping your dog. Oh, can you hear that? That's not my dog. It's my sister's dog.  She I think she would take a shower to her dog is like freaking out because she
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,24481,doesn't know what a shower I didn't know what a shower is  Where am I sister goes to shower it like freaks out how is dearest reading this  I'm looking at Destiny's screen so I'm a little bit delayed so I'm looking at
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,24498,Destiny's screen and I'm just looking at whatever's on the left side of the  chat so we're delayed a little bit. Darius, when I grow up, I want to be one of the girls  you've sexed and never talked to again. Well, you're very, you're almost like your mother
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,24519,then. Just be more like your mom and you can do that. Can you read the patch notes if  you're going to play League? No. What's your diaper size? Don't have one. Is your sister  a kumur. I want to know. Darius have read this. It's time to change your diaper. Okay.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,24546,When are you doing Blackface again? Never did it.  thoughts on Kennan is upcoming patch. What happened to Kennan? Darius, are you  banned here? Yes. How do you justify calling yourself an engineer? I am an engineer. Customer  service engineer. She is and he knows. Oh he's too fat for a diaper. I'm not fat.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,24565,Dares are you developing a diaper fetish? Um no. But I do know somebody in chat who has a diaper fetish.  And he's the biggest shitter in the chat. If anyone could uh feels weird man at Dunebug and ask him
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,24584,about his diaper fetish. That'd be great. There's how do you  differential equations apply to customer service? It's under  your business. You're not you're not a customer service  engineer.  Post your pics. Just go to my stream. Or go to my discord. We
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,24610,We have a great community in our discord.  They talk about poop and butt.  Yesterday we had a conversation about philosophy with a pro-Israel person last night in our  discord is very political.  You think Darius, right?  Darius is political.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,24627,But yeah, we get really political in our discord.  It's pretty based.  I'm calling someone a shitter when he literally shits himself.  I've never shipped myself ever.  Darius, what are your PC specs?  Um, I'm not too sure.  Wasn't that four days ago that was yesterday last those this morning.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,24649,It's usually whenever she joins.  Darius, do you want to glass Israel?  Like don't want to make the sand in the glass.  Darius, do you do butt stuff?  No.  What is better at democracy or a Hokage system?  Naruto sucks honestly and if anybody wants to be Hokage, you're pretty cringe.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,24680,Dares explain the image.  I can't click any images because I'm banned from chat.  Do you have an ETL when you expect the grout of diapers?  No.  Well, wait, I don't wear diapers ever.  So I wouldn't, I wouldn't know.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,24703,Are you ready?  He's not even here.  Nope.  Give me three minutes.  Sups in the micro soup time.  There's going to give me a job at your engineering company.  I could actually I got another DDG or my job and we work together
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,24722,That's where the thousand dollars went what do you mean  There's what do you even do?  I stream myself on Tinder.  I do degenerate stuff.  I larp as an anime character.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,24756,Nothing really too exciting, but it's um, if you ever feel bad about yourself, and you  something to make yourself feel a little bit better. My stream is always there.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,24791,and  Oh Lord.  So
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,24837,the  there's the unban comes when the mgs comes if he doesn't if it doesn't come  i can't do i'm trying to scroll up on a fucking stream and i can't read all the  ones that the next couple days
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,24853,who's gonna be a wild ride for some people god damn  what does that mean  it means we're going to diamond okay  Oh yeah, we only have like four days.  One Rank a Day. One Rank a Day. Tomorrow's Platt 2.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,24871,Next day's Platt 1.  Then, it's Diamond.  And then Destiny will quit League of Legends and he'll play Variety Full Time!  Be back one second.  I think it's almost done.  There's Please Get Corona so you won't have to watch League.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,24898,Well if I get Corona or die or something, Destiny will play League Solo.  Now if Destiny will play League Solo, what will happen is one of two things.  Then he will do good and it'll just be him playing League and listening to Flourish
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,24916,in the lag time over and over again for 8 hours.  The other option is he gets really mad and just quits stream after 2 hours.  So I think the alternative of me playing with him until he gets diamond and then leaving
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,24932,the game is a better option.  Is that the same logic you used to make wearing diapers normal?  I've never worn diaper in my life.  And I don't know how this is a thing.  What did you get your degree in?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,24948,Being a diaper man?  Haha, poo poo.  Okay.  St empowerment  darius read this to be valid  Do you think if I get an ego that GG and pay her to join my discord so that way more
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,24987,people will join?  It'll work?  I noticed that some girls have been joining our discord and it's been a lot more active.  time was a girl in there there's at least 10 guys in the voice chat.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,25021,Sorry, I always made it all the time. Shut up. Okay, Molina has a bunch of stuff in the  drawer for like seasoning like cayenne pepper and lemon pepper.  Can I pour random shit in like a store-bought soup or will it be like way too salty or
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,25032,what do you guys think?  You go for it.  I don't want to hurt it too much.  Well, are they normally really salty?  I don't want to taste it first.  I know sometimes people say like some soups have a lot of sodium in it already but throw
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,25048,it some like black pepper in it.  Black pepper that's like normal table pepper or ground pepper right?  Yep.  We have to taste the first one, it's too hot.  What kind of soup?  It says rice and chicken.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,25078,Wild rice and chicken soup.  It's like 180 calories for the whole can though.  It seems pretty good.  That apocalypse diet boys.  Do you have anything you might be lactose intolerant?  No.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,25108,Call of Duty model for a 2 is getting a remaster.  Oh, just a campaign.  Grinch.  Hold on one second.  Hot take.  The Call of Duty Black Ops story was pretty garbage.  The only reason why it's somewhat memorable  is because that's when PlayStation Network was down
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,25136,and like everything was down so people had to play the fucking story mode.  How's that false?  the whole number thing else all cringe
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,25171,oh yeah that was pretty if you had a ps3 during xbox live times you were pretty  cringe  Think PlayStation all right. I put in tie-in red pepper, so this should be fine. Oh  Good luck  You ready. Nope. I literally just made my soup and I'm chilling with it. Tell us how you're gonna save your mental the next few games, okay?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,25199,Okay, um, well, I have drink of red board. I'm getting a little bit more ready. I called by  The girl earlier. Oh wait tapers in here, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So what do you think is like, what are like good vegetables to add to everything?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,25217,What do you think?  Um, so you don't want to add corn because that has no extra carbs in it.  Yep. Stay away from corn since you told me.  I like, I like carrots.  Okay.  Um, broccoli.  Do you think peppers in general are good? Like green pepper, red pepper.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,25234,Oh yeah, yeah, I love that. Plus they have a lot of fiber.  Okay, and then like kale and spinach,  green stuff is good, right?  Yep, usually I don't really like kale,  but I'll eat like a spinach salad  with like a little bit of dressing.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,25247,What about onions and tomatoes?  Perfect.  Anything else?  Is there like a super vegetable I'm missing?  Moo, no.  I just chop all, oh man, I put too much,  I put so much in.  I just chop all these peppers up and all that vegetables.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,25261,I'm gonna put them like a container,  and then I add them to like all my sandwiches and soup.  So it should be okay, right?  It's like free vegetables.  Dude, you could literally you can like make a  a mix at the beginning of the week and just throw
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,25274,The veggies on do a salad the veggies on to a sandwich. Yeah  I used to just when I was trying to gain. I know you're trying to lose weight  But when I was trying to gain weight, I would just make like a
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,25285,shit ton of ground beef a shit ton of rice and then a shit ton of veggies and just throw it in a bowl and just  eat it as fast as I could  Um, it doesn't need to be like a fancy like, oh, wait, yeah.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,25298,I'm not so concerned with like just trying to lose weight or don't I pass?  I want to like, if I'm going to make food, it seems like really easy to just add vegetables  to everything.  It is super easy.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,25306,Yeah.  And you can eat a lot of them and not have it like, calorically, fuck you up.  It's probably good to get like vegetables and shit, right?  and  at

vPeG7O488v8,20200331,25355,I'm not really sure the one cereal I would eat  is like special, okay, it's like a protein one.  I like that one, but I mean, when you compare boxes,  like if you can get an extra like five grams of protein
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,25373,in a bowl of cereal, like why the hell not?  Sure.  Right, the soup, it's okay, but I poured in way too much  of the rope every so.  They're not red pepper, they'll climb on pepper.  How do you get a haircut during the fucking quarantine?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,25392,The real talk is all these people with their hair  that say they're super fucked up because of quarantine.  We've been corny for like two weeks.  I got my haircut cut like every six months.  How often you guys get your haircut?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,25402,That's the road.  I don't need my haircut every two months.  They go nice.  Oh, then you're fine.  You look like a haircut like every month.  That's crazy.  Fuck that shit.  That's look nice.  You get fucked up.  four to three months

There are people that will just join my discord and they'll post this like, there's an image  comparing like what it means if you're constipated.  And I don't know if these people actually think like my community talks about shit or
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,25486,something, but they'll just post like a graph on what is constipated shit versus diarrhea.  I don't know if they're just trying to bait not safe for life images or.  Good one.  Dario.  They're doing the good ones.  I'm just, I'm just here.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,25519,Oh, you're eating.  I'm sorry, that's not good.  Oh yeah, thanks for that.  My dude.  three months is too long
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,25554,Be there, be there to lie love  Times Square can never shine as bright  Did you guys hear about the actress who got stabbed?  No, what happened?  Grace?  What was wrong?  No, it was a knife.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,25585,Hey everybody, how's it going?  Usually when I discuss right to repair, I'm talking about laptop and cell phone repair,  particularly MacBooks and iPhones, or as I like to call them, luxury Facebook machines.  This gives people the impression that the set of principles and philosophies that I advocate for
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,25598,Only have to do with one company and if you're not talking about Apple that all of this just magically goes away  It doesn't the set of principles that I'm discussing the idea of  schematics being available of parts being available for sale of not making devices where this one chip is
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,25615,exclusive to this and nobody can buy it but us  applies to every field that applies to farmers with John Deere and applies to medical equipment and today  I would like to give you an example of that and why it is that I think right to repair is so important
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,25628,and culturally outside of laptop and so on.  Oh shit, I wonder if he's gonna talk about diabetic machines.  Oh, repair.  So this is an article from the BBC, and it's titled, Coronavirus Tech Firm Bloom Energy  Fixes Broken US Ventilators.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,25643,A Californian company that usually makes green energy fuel cells is due to deliver 170 repaired  ventilators to LA later on Monday after transforming its manufacturing process.  An engineer at Bloom Energy downloaded the service manual and taught himself how to dismantle
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,25659,and rebuild them in a day, the LA Times reported.  They had been in storage since the H5N1 bird flu outbreak of the mid-2000s.  Bloom said it is now working to find other stockpiles of disused machines.  On Saturday, as California Governor Gavin Newsom visited the manufacturing plant, he
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,25676,said, we got a car in a truck and had them brought here to this facility at eight this  morning.  they'll have those ventilators back into LA all fixed.  That's the spirit of California.  Now here's the punch line.  Mr. Newsom said that the original manufacturers had initially told him it would take a month
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,25692,to fix 200 ventilators, which helps patients breathe if they are having difficulties due  to COVID-19 or other diseases.  The original manufacturers had initially told him it would take a month to fix 200 ventilators,  which helps patients breathe.  And this company, not even an unauthorized ventilator repair company.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,25709,This is a company that has nothing to do with ventilator repair.  They don't produce ventilators, they do not repair ventilators, they do something else  entirely, and they were able to get the job done.  And 3% the time that the manufacturer quoted.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,25721,And every single one of you lobbyists keeps talking about how unauthorized repair is dangerous.  No only authorized repair should have access to this shit.  Your philosophy is going to get people killed.  I want you to think about this.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,25733,Imagine that you're 30 to 50 years older than you are now.  You get coronavirus and you're in a room.  You're close to the point where you can't breathe anymore.  You're this close to suffocating.  What would you rather have at the other end of the room?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,25744,A ventilator that we've fixed?  Or a little post a note that says, come back in a month.  I hope you can sleep at night reading  that anti-repair script you do at every hearing  to collect your salary.  That's it for me.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,25755,Now the real meme is if these ventilators  started fucking killing people  because they were repairing correctly.  Somebody made this cum challenge.  So like, this sounds okay.  Well, I guess I'm not really judging yet,  but maybe for future tips,
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,25765,I'll probably close this on like a month or something.  But like, this is just like a straight redo of what I did.  You didn't actually like add anything new to it.  My dude, sounds okay.  Hi, booksmarks, we're still going hard on the leagues, okay?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,25777,I love you though.  You
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,25808,You

vPeG7O488v8,20200331,25923,Yeah.  Yeah.  You don't need to open his door, man, for a huff and puff.  More now about his, yo, chinny chin chin.  Oh, my, he better still out.  We all been here with the back tank.  Well, I think it's not, Terrell.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,25947,I think it's not.  Yo, my knee's thick, then still,  it's that waste of my time.  There's no more to come back tomorrow.  And the next day...  And the next day...  And I will put a bullet in all y'all
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,25963,behind what happened right now.  You hurt?  yeah  All right, I'm done.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,26001,What?  What did you say?  What?  Hello?  Who is that?  Hello?  I'm in a shower.  Can you give me a moment?  Christ.  Who is that? Hello?  I'm in the shower. Can you give me a moment?  Right?  Christ.

vPeG7O488v8,20200331,26098,and economics. So the foundation of it is just within capitalist hegemony, the foundation  of econ that you learn. Do you still talk to stalled? I miss him.  Rule one framework. Marty versus Ram. So when you go to college and learn about econ,
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,26120,and  and  and  and certain majors only if you specialize in the the higher level courses are Marxist  like noneconomics may  but the foundation is just completely within the framework of  I
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,26173,though when I'm on the ground  Dude I'm not a breath now  There's people who have so played the art chat.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,26205,Nice.  It's time to cringe.  For Project Melody's thing, it's not AI at all.  It's just, well, I guess, is virtual reality stuff  like the models and everything, that's not AI.  Nothing with her stuff has anything to do with AI.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,26219,Yeah, I don't know why you could argue.  You're an engineer, you should fucking know this.  Maybe you could argue that like she trained a machine  to like study her movements for the,  like the software to like make her think appear or whatever.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,26231,Oh no, I'm sorry, I'm over the thing.  She says it's AI because she pretends  that she's like a virtual character.  That's like the course she is like,  Like she the persona is an AI. Yeah, okay. I thought it's called AI because like we're supposed to assume like
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,26248,Okay, I have plenty of time to finish our I'll be right back. What do you mean finish shower? What the fuck are you doing?  I'm fucking scrubbing!
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,26283,the  an analyst group that advises congress on medicare twenty nine new hospitals open  from 2015 to 2017, but 65 closed, mostly small months, 52% of them in rural counties.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,26316,If only there was a single-payer healthcare system that specifically focused on funding  hospitals in rural areas.  This is a gigantic problem in the United States of America.  We are a very vast country.  We're a gigantic country.  Geographically, we're very spread out.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,26330,And rural hospitals are a serious problem.  Because they're simply not profitable, you see.  They're simply not profitable, you see.  The pause that live in rural areas need to die or simply just move forehead  Pen an analyst group that advises Congress on Medicare 29 new hospitals open from 2015
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,26361,Hi everyone and cap here and I'm a social Darwinist  We're making this video as a united right to tell governments everywhere to stop printing money and need indeed  The weak must be allowed to suffer and die so that the strong may continue well
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,26377,It's really more about hyperinflation the more money you  Umm, more shillies  You solve sure but you actually created a lot of long term problems  Do you want to end up a socialist hellhole like Venezuela with a rat seat better than their own people rights or the
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,26394,Why my republic for example, I mean things were so bad that Nazi took over  On second thought are we printing enough money?  So we might have to let certain businesses fail  What we can't let businesses fail we've got vested interests to the money machine
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,26414,I got a plan  Keep in mind, we'll p-  What?  Why'd you stop it?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,26444,Stop what?  The video.  song.  It's gonna be epic dude.  You know that, do you know about the no shampoo mean that's going around?  Yeah, it's all just fuck.  What about it?  Is it like an actual thing?  Yeah, arguably there's like different levels of no shampoo.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,26470,What do you mean?  So some people argue that you shouldn't use any shampoos with any like sodium is it sodium  blorate or sodium some some type of like aggressive cleaner because they say it dries your scot  out too much.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,26482,Other so they are recommend shampoos with none of that sodium lorithyl or whatever or sulfates  or whatever something like that.  Other people say that you should you can use nimble shampoo but you should do it sparingly  like once a week and then you just use water otherwise some people go full no shampoo and
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,26498,they only use water to rinse their hair and they say that over time your oils will equalize  is something I don't know I tried that for like a month but my never did I don't  know I was never happy with it

vPeG7O488v8,20200331,26535,And I don't know if that's because I use it a lot of shampoo,  though.  When I was reading it with people  or saying that he's more conditioner,  it's gonna help it be more oily.  Oh, easy!  Why did you sigh?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,26552,Because we shouldn't have went in.  We went into it early.  Do you want to do this?  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait.  Pause, can't.  Dude, you have no patience.  Good luck.  You guys can get her.  Okay.  I'm starting this.  I'm hitting it four times and then I'm going to.

vPeG7O488v8,20200331,26817,And then season two sounded like basically every single thing was a Titan  Yeah, that's what I like the toilets were made out of Titans the fucking wall was made out of Titan's ground  Was everything was Titan's oxygen was made it so it looked really stupid when I read it
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,26830,But I've heard like for the anime heard now that it's out that season two and season three were actually really really really well done  Yeah, I don't know.

vPeG7O488v8,20200331,28292,I refresh the chat.  and some attack me. How's that possible?  You know, why is my hair brown in that image?  because you put the diaper on the wrong spot shut the fuck up dude I don't even
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,28328,understand  I'm just taking a guess dude.  Why diapers?  Play Nunu no.  Who said that?  The wolf squad say that?  Nunu is a dog shit champion.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,28359,I'm being down savage.  I don't know.  There is one of these images.  What image is this?  I don't know what you're talking about.  What images are you talking about?  Okay, dude. I refreshed a chat.  Okay, so there's some guy in chat that's really good at Photoshop.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,28382,I refreshed a chat.  Okay, so there's some guy in chat that's really good at Photoshop.  And he fucking photoshops the shit all over.  Okay, first off, I remember he wasn't that dirty in the last photo by the way.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,28395,And that's not even really.  He photoshopped diapers and a bag of diapers onto my floor.  And onto my body as well.  And he just thinks it's a fucking funny meme, dude.  That's photoshopped? That's pretty good of that's photoshopped.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,28411,His first I thought I said to it's busy long stockings and he thinks he's a fucking great a mimmer  Oh  Where are we?  Crap.  Who shit's on a go-away?  Is anybody?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,28441,Oh no.  You want to get some crazy ganks?  Yeah, you're actually going to gank me this game?  Yeah, I'm actually going to...  I'm actually going to do a little bit of...  Yeah, this is going to be a really gank heavy game.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,28459,How does your power set up work in oxygen I included I have four different oil wells right now  And then I milk oil from those and then I also take the natural gas and that runs through my power set up
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,28469,You've got natural gas generators drilling generators. I'm rebuilding my whole base up here though  So that I don't have these long commutes  I'm trying to condense everything and make everything super pretty because the buffs you get for like look at all these buffs for
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,28484,For having like gorgeous scenery is pretty insane  and  and then I want my base to be a little closer to space so they don't have to run as far to do it. I don't want to build like those tubes everywhere
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,28493,for that  also I have to deal with this at some point  if  the look into a petroleum Bacher or sour gas for them is that we use like the civilian oil right into
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,28523,right into petroleum and something else  the sour gas, I don't know.  I mean I could, but actually that would probably be better because you probably wouldn't have to manually work any of these oil refineries, which is a waste of duplicate time.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,28540,But that has to get really hot, right? You're talking 400 degrees, meaning you can't do that with aquatuners, I don't think.  Because aquatuners melt at 375, I think, even if you make it onto steel.  What is that right?
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,28554,Yeah  But I think that's gonna be one of the few manual things they have to do that and then digging out compost  I think I can auto automate almost everything else  Who did I get the wrong I did get there wrong whatever wrong what ruins again now
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,28572,Just um you keep from magma at the bottom my magma  I'm kind of fucking up right now though, and I imagine it's not gonna last forever  I have one wrong room.  That's fine.  Oh, I really like this witches song.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,28604,Right where is it?  Not this one. Oh, I really like this one  Fuck go you're you're early. I don't care how I'm behind you, but whatever  Good luck. Oh my god. Lily said I don't live on Lily. Keep going
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,28622,Go vain cuz she's I've got you. I've got you a heel  I'm not gonna go for trouble. Fuck it. Oh, I know. Fuck she held too much.  Where you guys steal that?  Of hands only  take his book.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,28657,Those are all fucking pretending he knows  Do you think they're good  No, I mean the enemy team they just got oh  oh that was fun, but more we've got kill say

vPeG7O488v8,20200331,30641,I could have done so much better that game.  Listen, this game, actually from that one,  I'm not losing a single game.  If we lose a game, I will.  I will.  On the next Rod Show that Rod puts me on,
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,30655,I will wear an actual diaper.  Wow.  and present myself in a bid.  So nothing changed, shut the fuck up.  It's not funny.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,30700,Do you actually owe them diaper strain steroids?  Hahaha, I don't owe them anything.  They go into my fucking stream and they're like, hey, if you don't get this in X amount  of time, you should wear a diaper.  I'm like, okay, whatever.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,30719,And then it ends up happening.  Okay, I've already been invited to Raj.  Raj, except to my friend request, he's just having another show and I need a message  about it.  It'll happen.

Bit late already talks a lot, but when viewing, I don't even know if he's still here, fuck,  he's probably gone.  When viewing relationships with your transactional framework, how do you personally figure out
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,34769,what other people want, whether they are being satisfied?  I mean, figuring out what people want is, and whether or not they're happy.  I mean, usually the best thing is to just ask, right?  I mean, I don't know, but it depends on the type of relationship, too.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,34781,In a business relationship, people usually have KPIs,  like key performance indicators.  Like, what do they want that they want you to sell ads?  They want you to sell merchandise, like check the numbers, I guess.  In personal relationships, people usually want somebody
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,34790,that they feel like is listening to them, somebody that can share  activities with them.  I mean, I don't know what's meant for the person.  I don't know if it sounded mean to say, just don't be autistic,  but you should be able to discern what people want
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,34802,or what somebody's going for in a given relationship,  whether it's business or personal.  It shouldn't be that hard to do.  Jesus fucking Christ.  Is that price a brocade amount?  No, it's somebody's birthday tomorrow, so we can't.
vPeG7O488v8,20200331,34848,Um, well, who's West by the way?  Elf girl fuck. Why is it eric?  Sounds great.  I have to go have a elf girl fuck. I love you all very much, okay?  Thanks again.
